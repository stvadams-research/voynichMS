# PHASE 4.5: FINAL CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Status:** FRAMEWORK-BOUNDED CLOSURE  
**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Structural Admissibility Program

---

## 1. Framework-Bounded Determination

The Voynich Manuscript Structural Admissibility Program has completed its evaluation of the artifact's structural and inferential landscape.

The program's determination within the tested framework is:

**Under tested structural and computational diagnostics, the Voynich Manuscript is structurally consistent with non-semantic procedural artifact classes.**

No statistical or computational method tested—including information clustering, network analysis, topic modeling, and morphology induction—has successfully separated the manuscript from sophisticated mechanical generative models. 

---

## 2. Exhaustion of Evidence

We have established that:
1.  **Complexity is not Meaning:** High structural density (z=5.68) is a necessary property of language, but it is also a sufficient property of rigid, glyph-level algorithmic production.
2.  **Repetition is Mechanical:** The manuscript's 90% repetition rate is fully explainable by bounded token pools (sizes 10-30) and does not require semantic intent.
3.  **Inference is Non-Diagnostic:** Current "proofs" of language in the literature are based on metrics that are highly susceptible to false positives from non-semantic structured gibberish.

Within this framework and current data, translation/semantic identification claims are **not evidentially supported**.

---

## 3. Criteria for Reopening

This project is conditionally closed unless new work can satisfy at least one of the following "Gatekeeper" criteria:

1.  **Irreducible Signal:** Identification of a statistical signal that survives comparison against all known non-semantic structured generators and cannot be reproduced without latent-state coupling.
2.  **External Grounding:** The discovery of independent external evidence (e.g., a bilingual crib or non-textual structural alignment) that bypasses pure text statistics.
3.  **Framework Shift:** A formally specified and acknowledged change to the admissibility framework that introduces new, falsifiable assumptions.

Absent these, the current closure remains a bounded inference about structural indistinguishability under tested methods.

## 4. What This Does Not Claim

This closure statement does not claim:

- proof of authorial intent,
- universal semantic impossibility under all future evidence,
- final historical interpretation of manuscript purpose.

## 5. Operational Entitlement State

Canonical operational entitlement source:

- `core_status/core_audit/release_gate_health_status.json`

Current gate-health class: `GATE_HEALTH_DEGRADED`.

While gate health remains degraded, closure language is operationally contingent and should be interpreted as qualified/reopenable rather than terminal.

Current degraded-state dependency is the SK-C1 release sensitivity evidence contract (`core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep_release.json`).

---

## 6. Final Metadata
- **Final Audit Status:** Green (Audit-Ready)
- **Primary Findings:** [Phase 2 Final Report](FINAL_REPORT_PHASE_2.md), [Phase 3 Final Report](FINAL_REPORT_PHASE_3.md), [Phase 4 Results](PHASE_4_RESULTS.md).
- **Archive:** Runs, code, and data are traceable under current provenance policy with explicit historical qualifiers.

## 7. Historical Provenance Confidence

Historical run-traceability confidence is currently classified as `PROVENANCE_QUALIFIED`
while legacy orphaned rows remain in the run ledger.

Current SK-M4.5 lane under this evidence state is `M4_5_BOUNDED`
(`m4_5_historical_lane` in the canonical provenance artifact).

Canonical provenance confidence source:

- `core_status/core_audit/provenance_health_status.json`

Policy source:

- `governance/HISTORICAL_PROVENANCE_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PROVENANCE.md`
