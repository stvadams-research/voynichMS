# PHASE 4.5: SEMANTIC ADMISSIBILITY FRAMEWORK

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Structural Admissibility Program  
**Objective:** Define the necessary conditions for statistical signals to be admissible as evidence of semantics.

## 1. Operational Definition of Semantics

For the purposes of statistical and computational phase4_inference, **semantics** is defined as:

> A stable mapping between symbolic variation and latent states that are not reducible to local mechanical constraints, reuse rules, or bounded generative procedures.

This definition establishes that "meaning" requires a dependency on something external to the production algorithm itself. If a signal can be generated by a purely mechanical process (like a table-lookup or a self-citing loop), it is **not** admissible as evidence of semantics.

## 2. The Four Necessary Conditions for Semantic Evidence

To be considered diagnostic of semantics, a statistical signal must satisfy **all** of the following conditions. Failure of any single condition renders the signal non-diagnostic (structurally descriptive only).

### C1: Non-Mechanical Irreducibility
The signal cannot be reproduced by any non-semantic generator with comparable structural constraints. If a simple mechanical model (e.g., Phase 3.3 pool-reuse) can generate the signal, the signal is a structural byproduct, not a semantic indicator.

### C2: Cross-Context Stability
The signal must persist under sectioning changes, resampling, and local perturbation. Semantic structure is macroscopic and resilient; mechanical reuse signals are typically fragile and dependent on exact partitions or token identities.

### C3: Latent-State Dependence
The signal must reflect dependencies that cannot be explained solely by token frequency, reuse locality, or production rules. It must imply an underlying "state" (meaning) that guides selection across the entire corpus.

### C4: Control Separability
The signal must cleanly separate known semantic corpora (natural languages) from all tested non-semantic structured corpora. Separating Voynich from "random noise" is insufficient; it must be separated from "structured gibberish."

## 3. The Inference Gap

Phase 4 demonstrated that existing methods fail to bridge the gap between **structural complexity** and **semantic necessity**. High information density, topic-like clustering, and network regularity are necessary properties of language, but they are also emergent properties of sophisticated mechanical rules. 

Therefore, these properties are **necessary but not sufficient** to infer the presence of language.

**Status:** Framework established.  
**Next:** Map Phase 4 methods to these conditions.
