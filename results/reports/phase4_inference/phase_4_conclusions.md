## 1. Summary of Findings

Phase 4 was designed to test the **diagnostic power** of phase4_inference methods commonly used to support claims of meaning or language in the Voynich Manuscript. By matching the manuscript against both semantic (natural language) and non-semantic (mechanically generated) corpora of equal scale, we have established the following:

1.  **Mechanical Sufficiency:** Non-semantic generative models (specifically Self-Citation and Mechanical Reuse) are sufficient to reproduce **every major statistical signal** previously cited as evidence of language.
2.  **False Positive Saturation:** Current phase4_inference methods (Information Clustering, WAN Metrics, Topic Modeling, Morphology Induction) are highly susceptible to false positives. In many tests, mechanical models outperformed natural language in "language-like" signatures.
3.  **Representational Invariance:** These results are robust across different transliterations and glyph-handling modes, indicating that the failure of these methods is rooted in the structure of the artifact, not the choice of encoding.

## 2. Impact on Admissibility

The findings of Phase 4 provide a definitive boundary for interpreting the manuscript:

- **Language Claims:** Claims that the manuscript "must" be a language because of its statistical properties are **formally unsupported**. The statistical properties of Voynich are entirely consistent with non-semantic procedural generation.
- **Methodological Collapse:** The widely cited papers (e.g., Montemurro & Zanette 2013, Amancio et al. 2013) are identified as **not diagnostic** of semantics at the manuscript's scale. Their findings, while descriptive, do not support an phase4_inference of meaning.

## 2.5 Method Status Source of Truth

Phase 4 method completion and outcome status are canonicalized in:

- `results/reports/phase4_inference/PHASE_4_STATUS_INDEX.json`

This avoids drift between summary prose and method-status tables.

## 3. Final Determination

**The Voynich Manuscript is structurally indistinguishable from a non-semantic procedural artifact.**

No current statistical or computational method has successfully separated the manuscript from sophisticated mechanical models. Consequently, the pursuit of translation or semantic identification based on structural statistics alone is considered **scientifically unjustified**.

## 4. Closure Statement

With the completion of Phase 4, the project has exhausted the admissible phase4_inference space. We have:
1.  Built a rigorous geometric phase1_foundation (Phase 1).
2.  Mapped the space of allowed explanations (Phase 2).
3.  Reconstructed the generative phase5_mechanism (Phase 3).
4.  Falsified the prevailing proofs of language (Phase 4).

The program has reached its logical conclusion. The manuscript remains a testament to the power of mechanical rules to simulate the complexity of meaning.
