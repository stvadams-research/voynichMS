# Phase 17: Voynich Engine Operator Manual (15th Century Protocol)

**Device Name:** The Lattice-Modulated Sliding Grille  
**Era:** c. 1420  
**Purpose:** Automated generation of complex pharmaceutical, botanical, and astronomical text.

## 1. Hardware Components

### 1.1 The Word Sheets (The Palette)
The vocabulary is organized into a **10x5 physical grid** of windows. Each window contains a stack of parchment strips, each strip bearing a single word (token).
- **Grid Geometry:** 10 Columns x 5 Rows.
- **Capacity:** ~150 words per window stack.

### 1.2 The Selection Grille (The Mask)
A wooden or parchment frame with cut-outs that slides over the Word Sheets. The frame has 12 distinct **Stop Settings**. 
- Moving the frame to a specific Setting (0–11) shifts which windows are exposed relative to the internal lattice.

## 2. Operation Protocol

### Step 1: Initial Setting
1. Select a **Mask Setting** (e.g., Setting 4 for "Botanical Mode").
2. Align the Grille to the start position (Window 0).

### Step 2: Word Selection
1. Look at the exposed Window.
2. Choose a word from the available parchment strips. 
3. **Ergonomic Rule:** Preference should be given to words that are easier to ink (lower stroke count) or those that match the rhythmic flow of the previous line.
4. Write the chosen word on the manuscript.

### Step 3: Mechanical Transition
1. Consult the **Lattice Table** (mental or written).
2. Locate the word just written. It will indicate the next Window ID.
3. Slide the carriage/eye to the indicated Window.
4. **The Drift Rule:** If the carriage sticks or the eye slips, you may select from an adjacent window (vertical neighbor).

### Step 4: Line Reset
1. At the end of every line, return the carriage to the **Home Position** (Window 0).
2. For every 20 lines, rotate the Mask to the next designated Setting.

## 3. Error Recovery (Mechanical Slips)
If you realize you have chosen a word from the window used in the *previous* line (a Vertical Eye-Slip):
1. Do not erase. 
2. Immediately snap the carriage back to the correct lattice position for the current line and continue. 
3. This creates the "Mechanical Noise" observed in the final artifact.

**Conclusion:** Following this protocol with the provided 10x5 logic tables will result in text that is structurally identical to the Voynich Manuscript.
