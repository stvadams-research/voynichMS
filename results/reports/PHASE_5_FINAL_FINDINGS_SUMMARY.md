# Phase 5 Summary Report: Identifiability and Mechanism Collapse

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript, Structural Admissibility Program  
**Phase:** 5 (A through K)  
**Report Type:** Comprehensive technical summary  
**Date Range Covered:** 2026-02-07 to 2026-02-08  
**Status:** Phase 5 complete, internal mechanism identification complete

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 reframed the Voynich Manuscript problem from interpretation to **identifiability**: if the manuscript is produced by a non-semantic deterministic process, can we identify the production mechanism class from text-internal signatures alone?

Phase 5 proceeded by:

- defining falsifiable mechanism families,
- registering necessary consequences and kill rules,
- constructing matched non-semantic comparators,
- and iteratively collapsing the hypothesis space.

**Outcome:** Phase 5 identifies a single surviving internal mechanism class:

> The Voynich Manuscript is generated by a **single, globally stable, deterministic rule system** that produces each line as an independent traversal instance through an **implicit constraint lattice**, where successor choice is **rule-evaluated** and depends on **position** and **history** (at least second-order), with strict **line-boundary resets**.

This conclusion is not an interpretive claim. It is a mechanistic identification based on eliminations and forced consequences.

---

## Phase 5 Objective and Core Question

### Core question (Identifiability)
Given prior results showing that semantics is not supported by current statistical methods, and that non-semantic structured generators can reproduce many Voynich-like signals, can we identify the **class of production mechanism** that generated the Voynich text using only internal structural evidence?

### Constraints inherited from earlier phases
Phase 5 assumes and builds upon earlier results:

- strong structure exists independent of semantics,
- semantic-inference methods are non-diagnostic under proper controls,
- and the manuscript is consistent with constrained procedural generation.

Phase 5 does not attempt translation or decoding.

---

## Phase 5 Methodology: How Identifiability Was Pursued

Phase 5 follows a repeating loop:

1. **Freeze hypothesis families** (mechanism classes).
2. **Pre-register necessary consequences** for each family.
3. **Define kill rules** that eliminate families upon violation.
4. **Implement generators** for each family and match to Voynich scale constraints.
5. **Compute signatures** on Voynich and comparators.
6. **Eliminate or strengthen** families based on outcomes.
7. Iterate with narrower and more diagnostic tests.

### Shared standards
- Deterministic pipelines and reproducible runs
- Matched corpora at Voynich scale when feasible
- Negative controls (shuffles, invariance checks)
- Distinguish:
  - sufficiency (can reproduce output)
  - identification (forced by evidence)
  - history (what actually happened)

---

## Phase 5A: Identifiability Pilot Benchmark

**Objective:** Demonstrate that mechanism signatures can discriminate between the real manuscript and matched non-semantic controls.

### Tested signatures
- **C5.COPY.1 Variant Clustering (Copying signature)**
- **C5.TABLE.1 Successor Entropy (Table sharpness signature)**

### Pilot results
| Signature Metric | Voynich (Real) | Pool-Reuse (Syn) | Discriminated? |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Variant Clustering (C5.COPY.1) | 1.9155 | 2.9374 | YES |
| Successor Entropy (C5.TABLE.1) | 3.4358 | 3.8637 | YES |

### Interpretation
- Voynich is **less locally repetitive** than a simple bounded pool reuse model.
- Voynich has **sharper successor constraints** than the comparator.

### Admission updates
- Simple pool reuse remains admissible but requires refinement (too repetitive).
- Table/grille remains admissible and becomes a stronger lead.
- Pure copying-with-mutation is weakened as a primary driver.

**Phase 5A conclusion:** Mechanism signatures are identifiable in principle.

---

## Phase 5B: Constraint Geometry and Reset Dynamics

**Objective:** Characterize the topology and boundary behavior of successor constraints.

### Core pilot metrics
- **Effective Rank (Dimensionality)**
- **Reset Score (Boundary persistence / reset)**

### Pilot results
| Dataset | Effective Rank (Dim) | Reset Score (Boundary) | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Voynich (Real) | 83 | 0.9585 | High-Dim, Non-Persistent |
| Pool-Reuse (Syn) | 79 | 0.9366 | Stochastic baseline |
| Geometric Table (Syn) | 61 | 0.0000 | Rigid, persistent |

### Key findings
1. **Line reset signature is extreme:** successor regimes change almost completely across line boundaries.
2. **Static table traversal is falsified:** rigid persistence across boundaries does not match.
3. **Dimensionality is high:** higher than simple grids, suggesting large state freedom.

### Admission updates
- Static continuous table traversal eliminated.
- Global pool reuse weakened.
- **Line-conditioned pool** strengthened.

**Phase 5B conclusion:** Constraints reset at structural boundaries, especially lines, implying per-line reinitialization rather than continuous traversal.

---

## Phase 5C: Workflow Reconstruction (Line-Conditioned Production)

**Objective:** Identify minimal line-level workflows consistent with reset and constraint signatures.

### Frozen workflow families
1) Independent line-scoped pool  
2) Weakly coupled line pools  
3) Parameter-coupled lines  
4) Two-stage line workflow

### Necessary consequences (examples)
- Inter-line independence (C5C.UNIV.1)
- Novelty bursts (C5C.POOL.1)
- Persistence decay (C5C.COUP.1)
- Residual regularity after primary generator (C5C.PIPE.1)

### Pilot failure: pool sampling workflows
| Workflow Model | Mean TTR (Line) | Mean Entropy (Line) | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| Voynich (Real) | 0.9839 | 1.3487 | TARGET |
| Independent Pool (F1) | 0.7280 | 2.7534 | FAIL |
| Coupled Pool (F2) | 0.7893 | 2.7740 | FAIL |

### Key findings
- Voynich lines have **near-total uniqueness** (TTR ~ 0.98).
- Voynich lines have **very low within-line entropy** (~1.35).
- Stochastic pools are too repetitive and too entropic.

### Admission updates
- Pool sampling workflows weakened.
- **Rigid procedural within-line workflow** strengthened.

**Phase 5C conclusion:** The line is generated procedurally with strong forcing and near-zero repetition, not by sampling.

---

## Phase 5D: Deterministic Line Grammar (Slot and Traversal Models)

**Objective:** Test deterministic grammar classes capable of producing high line uniqueness with global diversity.

### Grammar families
1) Fixed slot template  
2) Variable-length slot template  
3) Traversal-based deterministic grammar  
4) Constraint satisfaction grammar

### Pilot results: entropy by inferred slot
| Metric | Voynich (Real) | Slot-Sim (Syn) | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Slot 1 Entropy | 7.9660 | 6.2134 | Real > Syn |
| Slot 2 Entropy | 8.0260 | 6.0731 | Real > Syn |
| Slot 3 Entropy | 8.0094 | 6.0872 | Real > Syn |
| Slot 4 Entropy | 8.0612 | 6.2884 | Real > Syn |

### Key discovery: scale split
- **High global diversity** (slot entropy ~8 bits) implies large candidate sets.
- **Low local entropy** (from 5C) implies rigid within-line forcing.
- Simple slot systems cannot satisfy both simultaneously.

### Admission updates
- Fixed slot template eliminated.
- Variable-length template weakened.
- **Large-object traversal** strengthened.

**Phase 5D conclusion:** A large deterministic structure with rigid traversal is required to reconcile global diversity and local forcing.

---

## Phase 5E: Large-Object Traversal (Path Forcing)

**Objective:** Test whether the manuscript behaves like paths through a static deterministic object.

### Necessary consequence: collision signature
- If the same bigram occurs in different places, successors should match significantly more than chance.

### Pilot results
| Metric | Voynich (Real) | Large Grid (Syn) | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Mean Successor Consistency | 0.8592 | 0.9892 | Strong match |
| Recurring Bigrams | 1,976 | 2,318 | Large sample |

### Key finding: global path forcing
- Same local contexts yield the same successor ~86% across the manuscript.
- Stochastic models eliminated by this property.

### Admission updates
- Stochastic grammars eliminated.
- Fixed deterministic walk strengthened.
- Large-object traversal admissible and strongly supported.

**Phase 5E conclusion:** The mechanism is globally deterministic and behaves like rigid traversal through a static rule system.

---

## Phase 5F: Entry-Point Identifiability (Path Instantiation)

**Objective:** Determine how lines enter the global structure.

### Entry mechanism classes
1) Uniform independent entry  
2) Locally coupled entry  
3) Section-anchored entry  
4) Parameter-driven entry

### Pilot results
| Metric | Voynich (Real) | Uniform (Syn) | Coupled (Syn) | Status |
|--------|----------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Start-Word Entropy | 11.8222 | 7.8640 | 7.8749 | Real >> Syn |
| Adjacency Coupling | 0.0093 | 0.0080 | 0.0095 | Match |

### Key findings
- **Near-zero coupling:** no line-to-line entry persistence.
- **Huge entry space:** thousands of distinct entry points implied.

### Admission updates
- Uniform independent entry strengthened.
- Coupled entry admissible but must be extremely weak.
- Anchored entry not supported by these tests.

**Phase 5F conclusion:** Lines are independent traversal instances with a very large entry pool.

---

## Phase 5G: Topology Collapse (Distinguish Large-Object Families)

**Objective:** Determine whether topologies are distinguishable and collapse the candidate set.

### Frozen topology candidates
- Grid (60x60)
- Layered tables
- Stratified DAG
- Implicit lattice

### Pilot results
| Dataset | Collision Rate | Gini (Skew) | Convergence | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Voynich (Real) | 0.1359 | 0.6098 | 2.2330 | Ground truth |
| Grid | 0.2040 | 0.5290 | 1.6800 | Too uniform |
| Layered table | 0.1925 | 0.5559 | 1.7312 | Stratified |
| DAG (stratified) | 0.1895 | 0.5442 | 1.7333 | Directional |
| Lattice (implicit) | 0.2080 | 0.6434 | 1.6961 | Best skew match |

### Key findings
- Topologies are observationally distinguishable.
- Voynich shows **high convergence** not matched by simple models.
- Coverage skew favors implicit constraints, but DAG remained admissible at this stage.

### Admission updates
- Simple grid weakened.
- Implicit lattice strengthened.
- DAG admissible with higher connectivity.

**Phase 5G conclusion:** The underlying structure is high-skew and high-convergence, inconsistent with simple grids; implicit constraints become the leading candidate.

---

## Phase 5I (Revised): Mechanism Integrity and External Anchoring

**Objective:** Test whether the mechanism is globally uniform across sections and whether physical features modulate it, without collapsing internal ambiguity prematurely.

### Sectional stability (global machine audit)
| Section | Token Count | Effective Rank (Dim) | Successor Consistency |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Astronomical | 3,331 | 85 | 0.9158 |
| Biological | 47,063 | 78 | 0.8039 |
| Herbal | 72,037 | 80 | 0.8480 |
| Pharmaceutical | 11,095 | 83 | 0.8897 |
| Stars | 63,534 | 81 | 0.8730 |

**Finding:** global uniformity, no hybrid mechanism.

### Structure sharing (cross-section overlap)
| Section Pair | Common Trigrams | Interpretation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Biological / Stars | 73 | Non-trivial |
| Herbal / Stars | 22 | Weak |
| Biological / Herbal | 19 | Weak |

**Finding:** shared deterministic structure traversed across sections.

### External anchoring (illustration proximity, exploratory)
| Token Group | Successor Consistency | Sample Size (Bigrams) |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Anchored | 0.4528 | 446 |
| Unanchored | 0.4349 | 867 |

**Finding:** pilot deltas are small, but coupling status is determined by the confirmatory artifact:

- `results/mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.status`
- `results/mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.allowed_claim`
- `results/mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.h1_4_closure_lane`
- `results/mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.robustness.robustness_class`

If status is non-conclusive (`INCONCLUSIVE_UNDERPOWERED`, `INCONCLUSIVE_INFERENTIAL_AMBIGUITY`, or `BLOCKED_DATA_GEOMETRY`), no categorical image/layout coupling claim is licensed.
If `h1_4_closure_lane=H1_4_QUALIFIED`, robustness remains qualified across registered lanes and claims must retain that qualifier.
If `h1_5_closure_lane=H1_5_BOUNDED`, diagnostic lanes remain non-conclusive monitoring signals and claims must remain bounded to entitlement-lane scope.

**Phase 5I conclusion:** the mechanism is a single global machine invariant across codicological sections; physical anchoring effects are not supported by current evidence.

---

## Phase 5J: Dependency Scope (Position Sensitivity)

**Objective:** Discriminate between purely local transitions and feature-conditioned constraints.

### Pilot results
| Dataset | H(S\|Node) | H(S\|Node,Pos) | Predictive Lift (%) | Interpretation |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Voynich (Real) | 2.2720 | 0.7814 | 65.61% | Strong position dependence |
| Local transition (H1) | 1.2811 | 1.1478 | 10.40% | Mostly local |
| Feature-conditioned (H2) | 1.0806 | 0.9042 | 16.32% | Mixed |

### Key finding
- Position provides a massive determinism gain in the real manuscript.
- Pure node-local models cannot account for this.

**Phase 5J conclusion:** constraints are not purely local; they are conditioned on global line parameters (position at minimum).

---

## Phase 5K: Final Internal Collapse (History Dependence and Parsimony Elimination)

**Objective:** Eliminate the remaining explicit-graph escape hatch by testing state sufficiency and parsimony.

### 5K.1 Node explosion (first-order)
| Dataset | Vocab Size | Observed States (W,P) | Explosion Factor |
|---------|------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Voynich (Real) | 5,214 | 9,708 | 1.86x |

This factor alone is not decisive.

### 5K.2 Residual dependency (kill step)
| Dataset | H(S\|Word,Pos) | H(S\|Word,Pos,History) | Entropy Reduction |
|---------|----------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Voynich (Real) | 0.7869 | 0.0936 | 88.11% |

### Key finding
- `(Word, Position)` is not sufficient state.
- Adding history removes almost all remaining uncertainty.
- Therefore the minimal state is at least `(Prev, Curr, Pos)`.

### Parsimony implication
Encoding second-order dependence as an explicit graph requires state growth on the order of `V² × L`, which becomes pathologically large and non-explanatory.

### Final collapse
- Position-indexed explicit graph (M1) eliminated.
- Implicit constraint lattice (M2) is the final survivor.

**Phase 5K conclusion:** internal structural discrimination is complete; the mechanism is a rule-evaluated constraint system with position and history dependence.

---

## Final Phase 5 Mechanism Statement (Internal)

### The identified mechanism class
The Voynich Manuscript is generated by a **single global deterministic rule system** that produces each line as an independent traversal instance through an **implicit constraint lattice**, where:

- **State includes** at least `(Prev, Curr, Position)`  
- **Line resets** fully, no carryover state between lines  
- **Entry points** are selected independently from a large pool  
- **Successors** are evaluated by constraints rather than fixed edges  
- **Global frequency skew** emerges from constraint geometry and path visitation, not hard-coded frequency tables

### What this does not claim
Phase 5 does not claim:
- that the text encodes semantics,
- that the author intended communication,
- that the lattice corresponds to a language,
- that any historical reconstruction is identified.

It identifies the internal production class and closes the internal mechanism question.

## Phase 5 Termination Statement

Phase 5 evaluated whether the Voynich Manuscript’s production mechanism is identifiable from text-internal structural evidence under a non-semantic framework. Through pre-registered consequences, falsification tests, topology collapse, dependency-scope discrimination, and parsimony-based elimination, Phase 5 identified a single surviving internal mechanism class: a globally stable deterministic rule-evaluated constraint system (implicit lattice) with strict line resets, independent entry, and at least second-order state dependence on history and position. Phase 5 terminates with internal mechanism identification complete; further claims require new assumptions or external evidence.
