# PHASE 5G TOPOLOGY NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Topology Collapse  
**Objective:** Define the measurable signatures required for a topology to remain admissible.

---

## 1. Consequence: C5G.COV.1 (Coverage Compatibility)
- **Statement:** The distribution of word visitation frequencies must match the Voynich Zipf-like profile.
- **Kill rule:** If a topology requires an explicit, non-emergent frequency table to match the manuscript's word distribution, it is eliminated as non-explanatory.

## 2. Consequence: C5G.OVR.1 (Overlap Structure)
- **Statement:** The frequency of distinct lines sharing a common word-sequence (prefix collision) must fall within the manuscript's empirical envelope.
- **Kill rule:** If prefix collision length distribution is significantly higher or lower than the real manuscript, the topology is eliminated.

## 3. Consequence: C5G.SYM.1 (Symmetry Absence)
- **Statement:** No strong global symmetry (axial or rotational) may be detectable beyond shuffled controls.
- **Kill rule:** If a topology imposes detectable grid-like symmetries not present in the manuscript, it is eliminated.

**Status:** Consequences registered.  
**Next:** Implement topology simulators and overlap analysis.
