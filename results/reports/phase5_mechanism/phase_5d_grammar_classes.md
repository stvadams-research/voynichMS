# PHASE 5D GRAMMAR CLASSES: DETERMINISTIC PRODUCTION MODELS

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Deterministic Line Grammar  
**Objective:** Define the minimal deterministic grammars to be evaluated for structural sufficiency.

## 1. Fixed Slot Template
- **Defining Assumptions:** Each line follows a rigid, non-repeating sequence of $N$ slots. Each slot draws from a disjoint token set.
- **Mechanism:** $L = [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N]$. No skipping, no repetition.
- **What it explains:** Perfect TTR, absolute positional regularity.
- **Key Vulnerability:** Fails to account for variable line lengths.

## 2. Variable-Length Slot Template
- **Defining Assumptions:** Lines follow an ordered sequence of slots, but some slots are optional or repeatable (under exclusion).
- **Mechanism:** $L = [S_1?, S_2*, ..., S_N?]$. Selection is deterministic once parameters are fixed.
- **What it explains:** Variance in line length while maintaining order.
- **Key Vulnerability:** Risk of hidden stochasticity if skip rules are too flexible.

## 3. Traversal-Based Deterministic Grammar
- **Defining Assumptions:** The line is generated by a deterministic traversal of a structured object (e.g., a path on a grid or a walk on a graph).
- **Mechanism:** $L = Traversal(Object, Path_i)$. The path is fixed per line but can vary between lines.
- **What it explains:** Strong successor constraints driven by the object's geometry.
- **Key Vulnerability:** May over-predict transition consistency across lines if the object is static.

## 4. Constraint Satisfaction Grammar
- **Defining Assumptions:** Words are selected such that they satisfy a set of line-level constraints (e.g., "Must include glyph X," "Must not exceed length Y").
- **Mechanism:** $L = Solve(Constraints_i)$. The first valid sequence found is the line.
- **What it explains:** Emergent order and consistency without explicit slots.
- **Key Vulnerability:** Often over-parameterized; hard to distinguish from random choice without clear constraint definitions.

**Status:** Grammar families frozen.  
**Next:** Pre-register necessary consequences and implement boundary detection.
