# PHASE 5I RESULTS: MECHANISM INTEGRITY AND EXTERNAL ANCHORING

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Phase Complete (Conservative Revision)
**Objective:** Determine whether the manuscript's production phase5_mechanism is globally uniform or modulated by physical features.

## 1. Sectional Stability Analysis (Global Machine Audit)

We measured the stability of core phase5_mechanism signatures across major manuscript sections to test for algorithmic consistency.

| Section | Token Count | Effective Rank (Dim) | Successor Consistency |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Astronomical** | 3,331 | 85 | 0.9158 |
| **Biological** | 47,063 | 78 | 0.8039 |
| **Herbal** | 72,037 | 80 | 0.8480 |
| **Pharmaceutical** | 11,095 | 83 | 0.8897 |
| **Stars** | 63,534 | 81 | 0.8730 |

### Finding: Global Uniformity
The core phase5_mechanism signatures are remarkably stable across all tested sections. Latent dimensionality remains consistent at **~80**, and successor consistency (path forcing) remains high (**>0.80**) throughout. This confirms the **Global Machine Hypothesis**: the manuscript is the product of a single, unified rule-system.

## 2. Structure Sharing (Cross-Section Overlap)

We quantified the sharing of 3-word path fragments (trigrams) between sections.

| Section Pair | Common Trigrams | Interpretation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Biological / Stars** | **73** | **Non-Trivial Overlap** |
| **Herbal / Stars** | 22 | Weak Overlap |
| **Biological / Herbal** | 19 | Weak Overlap |

### Finding: Shared Object Traversal
The existence of a shared core of 73 trigrams between distant sections (Biological and Stars) confirms that different sections are **traversing the same underlying deterministic structure**. The sections are not algorithmically distinct; they are different instances of path-finding across a single global object.

## 3. External Anchoring (Proximity Coupling)

We tested whether proximity to physical illustrations modulated the determinism of the phase5_mechanism.

| Token Group | Successor Consistency | Sample Size (Bigrams) |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Anchored (Near Illustrations)** | **0.4528** | 446 |
| **Unanchored (Block Text)** | **0.4349** | 867 |

### Finding: Layout Independence (Exploratory)
Pilot delta estimates are small, but this table is exploratory only. Conclusive image/layout coupling status must be read from:

- `results/phase5_mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.status`
- `results/phase5_mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.allowed_claim`
- `results/phase5_mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` -> `results.h1_5_closure_lane`

Interpretation must not exceed the emitted status class (`CONCLUSIVE_*`, `INCONCLUSIVE_UNDERPOWERED`, `INCONCLUSIVE_INFERENTIAL_AMBIGUITY`, or `BLOCKED_DATA_GEOMETRY`).

### Current Confirmatory Status Snapshot

- `results.status`: `CONCLUSIVE_NO_COUPLING`
- `results.status_reason`: `adequacy_and_inference_support_no_coupling`
- `results.allowed_claim`: No robust image/layout coupling signal was detected under the configured adequacy and phase4_inference criteria.
- `results.h1_4_closure_lane`: `H1_4_QUALIFIED`
- `results.h1_5_closure_lane`: `H1_5_BOUNDED`
- `results.robustness.robustness_class`: `MIXED`
- `results.robustness.entitlement_robustness_class`: `ROBUST`
- H1.4 qualifier: robustness remains qualified across registered lanes.
- H1.5 boundary: diagnostic lanes remain non-conclusive monitoring signals.
- Latest run reference: `results/phase5_mechanism/anchor_coupling_confirmatory.json` (`run_id=a2c8da85-c0f5-874c-27d1-8455688f98a9`)

## 4. Final Determination: Mechanism Integrity

Phase 5I has established the following:
1.  **Single-Source Integrity:** The Voynich Manuscript is generated by a **single global deterministic machine**.
2.  **Structural Invariance:** The phase5_mechanism is uniform across all codicological sections.
3.  **Path Diversity:** Section-level differences are driven by different **entry points and traversal paths**, not by different production rules.
4.  **Multimodal Guardrail:** Illustration-coupling claims are bounded by the confirmatory SK-H1 status artifact.

### Deferred Questions
While a single global machine is confirmed, the following internal properties remain underdetermined and are deferred to the next phase:
- **Topology Discrimination:** Whether the structure is a High-Connectivity Graph (DAG) or an Implicit Constraint Lattice.
- **Dependency Scope:** The exact locality versus global-feature dependence of the constraints.

---
**Conclusion:** Phase 5I completes the phase5_mechanism integrity core_audit. Current illustration-coupling evidence is status-gated as `CONCLUSIVE_NO_COUPLING`, with H1.4 closure lane `H1_4_QUALIFIED` because robustness remains qualified across registered lanes, and H1.5 closure lane `H1_5_BOUNDED` because diagnostic lanes remain non-conclusive monitoring signals.
