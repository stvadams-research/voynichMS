# PHASE 5 HYPOTHESIS CLASSES: IDENTIFIABILITY OF PRODUCTION MECHANISMS

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Identifiability Phase  
**Objective:** Define the finite set of mechanism classes to be evaluated for structural admissibility.

---

## 1. Bounded Pool Reuse
- **Defining Assumptions:** Tokens are drawn from a limited, locally-replenished pool. No latent state beyond pool membership and simple selection heuristics.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Pool size per page/section, replenishment rate, selection bias (e.g., preference for recently used tokens).
- **Allowed Transforms:** Permutation within the pool, limited morphological variation (if grammar-compatible).
- **What counts as an instance:** Any process where the repetition anomaly is driven by pool exhaustion rather than global semantics.
- **Explicitly excluded:** Global semantic dependencies, open-vocabulary natural language.

## 2. Table or Grille Selection
- **Defining Assumptions:** Tokens are generated by traversing a pre-constructed grid of components (prefixes, infixes, suffixes). Hidden row/column states determine output.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Table dimensions, component distributions, traversal rules (e.g., knight's move, snake), grille pattern.
- **Allowed Transforms:** Systematic component swapping, grille rotation.
- **What counts as an instance:** Rugg-style or Zandbergen-style table-driven generation.
- **Explicitly excluded:** Stochastic grammar without hidden spatial states.

## 3. Copying with Systematic Mutation
- **Defining Assumptions:** New text is produced by copying existing passages and applying constrained edits (substitutions, insertions, deletions).
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Mutation rate, copy window size, edit distance constraints.
- **Allowed Transforms:** Local rearrangements, phonetic-like substitutions.
- **What counts as an instance:** Any "scribal copying" model where variation is driven by replication errors or deliberate local mutation.
- **Explicitly excluded:** Creation of entirely novel tokens without a local parent.

## 4. Multi-Stage Pipeline
- **Defining Assumptions:** The final output is the result of multiple sequential processes (e.g., Table output -> Phonetic smoothing -> Normalization).
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Number of stages, specific transform family at each stage.
- **Allowed Transforms:** Any combination of the above classes followed by a global filter.
- **What counts as an instance:** A hybrid model where "raw" structural signatures are masked by a secondary process.
- **Explicitly excluded:** Single-stage end-to-end models.

## 5. Low-Entropy Codebook Mapping
- **Defining Assumptions:** Tokens map to a small set of latent categories (semantic or syntactic) with very low entropy.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Codebook size, mapping redundancy, category transition rules.
- **Allowed Transforms:** Synonymous token replacement.
- **What counts as an instance:** A "cipher" into a very limited set of concepts or placeholders.
- **Explicitly excluded:** Full-spectrum natural language.

## 6. Compressed or Abbreviated Natural Language
- **Defining Assumptions:** Natural language under extreme compression, abbreviation, and orthographic distortion. Semantics present but masked.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Compression ratio, abbreviation rules, language family.
- **Allowed Transforms:** Vowel deletion, consonant clustering, acronymization.
- **What counts as an instance:** A "shorthand" model where statistical anomalies arise from the compression algorithm.
- **Explicitly excluded:** Purely mechanical nonsense without a semantic source.

**Status:** Hypothesis classes frozen.  
**Next:** Pre-register necessary consequences and kill rules.
