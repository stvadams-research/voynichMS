## Phase B: Comparative and Contextual Classification

This document contains the fixed anchor scores for the Voynich Manuscript across all 12 comparison dimensions.

---

| Dimension | Score | Evidence Source |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 4 | Phase 6C: 3.5 bits entropy reduction under conditioning. |
| 2. State-Space Sparsity | 5 | Phase 6A: 96% hapax ratio in visited state space. |
| 3. Novelty Convergence | 4 | Phase 6A: Consistent declining novelty curve (exhaustion). |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 4 | Phase 6B: High novelty density (0.32 unique/token). |
| 5. Reuse Suppression | 5 | Phase 6B: Near-total avoidance of line-level redundancy (0.01). |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 5 | Phase 5B: Extreme reset signature (0.95) at line boundaries. |
| 7. Human Effort Proxy | 3 | Phase 7A: Moderate complexity (1.7 strokes/char); sustained discipline. |
| 8. Correction Density | 2 | Phase 7A: 15 corrections per 100 lines; disciplined but phase7_human. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 1 | Phase 7B: Weak (-0.11) correlation between text and page geometry. |
| 10. Global Stability | 4 | Phase 5I: Single global machine invariant across sections. |
| 11. Positional Conditioning | 5 | Phase 5J: Position provides massive determinism lift (65%). |
| 12. History Dependence | 4 | Phase 5K: Second-order history required for state sufficiency. |

### Summary Vector
`VM_VECTOR = [4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]`

### Interpretation
The Voynich Manuscript is a **hyper-disciplined, ultra-sparse, position-sensitive formal system** that is largely indifferent to its physical container but strictly governed by its internal state resets and combinatorial exhaustion.
