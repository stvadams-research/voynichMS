## Phase B: Comparative and Contextual Classification

### Objective Summary
Phase B aimed to situate the Voynich Manuscript within the space of phase7_human-produced formal artifacts using non-semantic phase8_comparative metrics.

### Key Findings
1.  **Lullian Alignment (uncertainty-qualified):** Lullian-style systems remain the nearest point-estimate neighbor (Dist: 5.0990), but nearest-neighbor stability is moderate under perturbation.
2.  **Structural Isolation (uncertainty-qualified):** Voynich remains separated from natural-language and simple-table controls in point estimates, while phase8_comparative rank confidence is currently bounded by the uncertainty status.
3.  **Unique Profile:** Voynich's unique combination of **extreme reuse suppression** (Score 5) and **high history dependence** (Score 4) is not matched by any single artifact in the library.

### Comparison Results
- **Lullian Wheels:** Share VM's positional conditioning and reset dynamics but lack its memory (history dependence). Current distance CI is broad and nearest-neighbor stability is not yet high-confidence.
- **Magic Squares:** Share VM's sparsity and reuse suppression but are rigidly grid-locked.
- **Latin (Language):** Remains structurally distant in point estimate (Dist: 8.4853), with uncertainty interval still well above the nearest-neighbor cluster.

### Comparative Uncertainty Qualification
- This phase3_synthesis is explicitly **uncertainty-qualified**.
- Primary uncertainty artifact: `results/phase7_human/phase_7c_uncertainty.json`.
- Current nearest-neighbor stability, rank stability, and top-2 gap robustness are reported there and should gate claim strength.
- Current status from that artifact is `INCONCLUSIVE_UNCERTAINTY`; phase8_comparative claims remain directional and caveated.
- Under SK-M2.5 lane semantics, this state is interpreted as `M2_5_BOUNDED` when diagnostic completeness and claim-boundary checks pass.
- Missing-folio objections are non-blocking for SK-M2 unless phase8_comparative artifacts show objective phase8_comparative-input validity failure caused by missing source pages.

### Non-Semantic Conclusion
The Voynich Manuscript behaves structurally like a **complex, memory-augmented combinatorial engine**. It belongs to the class of **formal, disciplined executions** where state-exhaustion and rule-adherence override communicative efficiency.

---

### Boundary Reassertion
- This phase does **not** claim the Voynich Manuscript *is* a Lullian device.
- It identifies Lullian-like combinatorial logic as the most statistically similar production mode.
- No semantic content has been inferred.

### Conditionally Closed Statement
Phase B has mapped the Voynich Manuscript into artifact space within the current phase8_comparative library and metric set. Further comparison against currently represented artifacts is unlikely to significantly reduce the remaining structural distance.

This conclusion is framework-bounded, uncertainty-qualified, and reopenable under the canonical criteria in `governance/REOPENING_CRITERIA.md`.

**Phase B remains conditionally bounded within the current framework, with closure status operationally contingent on gate-health recovery.**

### Operational Entitlement State
- Canonical operational entitlement source: `core_status/core_audit/release_gate_health_status.json`
- Current gate-health class: `GATE_HEALTH_DEGRADED`
- Under this state, closure and phase8_comparative claims remain operationally contingent and should be interpreted as qualified/reopenable rather than terminal.
- Current degraded-state dependency is the SK-C1 release sensitivity evidence contract (`core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep_release.json`).
