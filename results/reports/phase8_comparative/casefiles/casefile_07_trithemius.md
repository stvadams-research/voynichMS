### 4. Structural Signatures (Scored 0–5)
| Dimension | Score | Evidence / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 5 | Perfect; fixed substitution rules masked as prayers. |
| 2. Sparsity | 2 | Uses common words/states to hide. |
| 3. Novelty Conv. | 1 | Low; cycles through a fixed set of "safe" words. |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 1 | Low; extreme "null" redundancy to mask message. |
| 5. Reuse Suppress. | 0 | None; repetition is common in liturgical masking. |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 1 | Low; state carries across words. |
| 7. Effort Proxy | 4 | High cognitive load to maintain masking rule. |
| 8. Correction Dens. | 2 | Moderate; errors in mask-rule are easy to make. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 1 | Indifferent to layout. |
| 10. Global Stab. | 5 | Rigid global machine. |
| 11. Positional Cond. | 5 | Extreme; substitution rule depends on word index. |
| 12. History Depend. | 2 | Low; local masking rules. |

### 6. Summary and VM Distance
- **Key Alignment:** Determinism, Global Stability, Positional Conditioning.
- **Key Deviation:** Reuse Suppression, Path Efficiency (Steganography is redundant).
- **Estimated Proximity:** **Moderate**
