## Artifact: Classical Latin (Control)

---

### 1. Artifact Identity
- **Name:** Classical Latin
- **Category:** Natural Language
- **Approximate Date/Origin:** 1st Century BCE - 1st Century CE
- **Primary Source(s):** Standard classical corpora (e.g., De Bello Gallico).

### 2. Physical Description (Non-Interpretive)
- **Format:** Codex / Scroll
- **Scale:** ~230,000 tokens (matched to Voynich scale)
- **Layout:** Continuous text flow.

### 3. Production Workflow
- **Constraints:** Linguistic grammar, semantics, narrative logic.
- **Human Factors:** Standard scribal copying; high error tolerance (minor slips don't break the system).
- **Tool Reliance:** Stylus/Pen; no formal combinatorial devices.

### 4. Structural Signatures (Scored 0–5)
| Dimension | Score | Evidence / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 3 | High for bigrams, but decays rapidly with history. |
| 2. Sparsity | 2 | Zipfian distribution; common states are highly repetitive. |
| 3. Novelty Conv. | 1 | Low; new words/forms appear throughout but no "exhaustion." |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 2 | Moderate; communicative redundancy is high. |
| 5. Reuse Suppress. | 1 | Low; repetition of function words is extreme. |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 1 | Low; state carries across boundaries (narrative/syntax). |
| 7. Effort Proxy | 2 | Standard cursive complexity. |
| 8. Correction Dens. | 1 | Low in formal copies; higher in drafts. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 3 | Margin awareness; line wrapping. |
| 10. Global Stab. | 5 | Language remains stable across thousands of pages. |
| 11. Positional Cond. | 2 | Low; syntax is flexible (especially in Latin). |
| 12. History Depend. | 3 | Strong sentential context; weak across paragraphs. |

### 5. Semantic Leakage Audit
- [x] No Content Assumption
- [x] No Efficiency Assumption
- [x] Structural Grounding Verified

### 6. Summary and VM Distance
- **Key Alignment:** Global stability.
- **Key Deviation:** Reset dynamics, Sparsity, Reuse Suppression.
- **Estimated Proximity:** **Distant**
