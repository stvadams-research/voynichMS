### 4. Structural Signatures (Scored 0–5)
| Dimension | Score | Evidence / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 5 | Total; mathematical sequence. |
| 2. Sparsity | 5 | Perfect; every state (number) visited exactly once. |
| 3. Novelty Conv. | 5 | Perfect; fixed sequence ending. |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 5 | Maximum; zero redundancy. |
| 5. Reuse Suppress. | 5 | Absolute; numbers cannot repeat in a square. |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 5 | Total; each square starts fresh. |
| 7. Effort Proxy | 4 | High cognitive load for mental calculation. |
| 8. Correction Dens. | 3 | High; calculation errors are common. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 5 | Absolute; grid-based. |
| 10. Global Stab. | 5 | Mathematical invariant. |
| 11. Positional Cond. | 5 | Total; position determines value. |
| 12. History Depend. | 1 | None; memoryless calculation. |

### 6. Summary and VM Distance
- **Key Alignment:** Sparsity, Reuse Suppression, Reset Dynamics.
- **Key Deviation:** Layout Coupling (Magic squares are rigid grids; VM is indifferent).
- **Estimated Proximity:** **Moderate**
