---

### 4. Structural Signatures (Scored 0–5)
| Dimension | Score | Evidence / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 5 | Total; mechanical permutation. |
| 2. Sparsity | 4 | High; many combinations are unique. |
| 3. Novelty Conv. | 5 | Perfect; exhaustive permutation set. |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 4 | High; designed to explore all unique states. |
| 5. Reuse Suppress. | 3 | Moderate; depends on traversal strategy. |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 5 | Total; each combination is independent. |
| 7. Effort Proxy | 3 | Mechanical aid reduces cognitive load. |
| 8. Correction Dens. | 1 | Low; tool prevents most errors. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 0 | Indifferent; results can be written anywhere. |
| 10. Global Stab. | 5 | Invariant global machine. |
| 11. Positional Cond. | 5 | Absolute; position in output = wheel in device. |
| 12. History Depend. | 0 | None; independent states. |

### 6. Summary and VM Distance
- **Key Alignment:** Determinism, Reset Dynamics, Positional Conditioning.
- **Key Deviation:** History Dependence (Lullian wheels are memoryless).
- **Estimated Proximity:** **Close**
