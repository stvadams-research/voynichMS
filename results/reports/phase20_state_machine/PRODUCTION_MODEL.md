# The Voynich Production Model: Complete Specification

**Generated:** Phase 20, Sprint 11 — Production Workflow Synthesis

This document presents the complete, integrated production model for the Voynich Manuscript as reconstructed across Phases 14-20. A third party can use this specification to understand how the manuscript was produced using a mechanical constraint system.

---

## 1. Physical Tool Specification

The production tool consists of two components:

### 1.1 State Tracker (Tabula)

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Form | Flat card (tabula) |
| Dimensions | 170 x 160mm |
| Layout | 10 x 5 grid (50 window positions) |
| Per-cell content | Window number + correction offset |
| Materials | Parchment or stiff paper |
| Historical parallel | Alberti cipher disc (1467), Trithemius tabula recta (1508) |

The tabula encodes 50 window states, each labeled with a window number (0-49) and a correction offset (range -20 to +13). 43 of 50 windows have non-zero corrections.

### 1.2 Vocabulary Codebook

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Total words | 7717 |
| Pages | 154 |
| Quires | 10 |
| Organization | By window number (W0-W49) |
| Page capacity | ~60 words per page (2 columns x 30 rows) |
| Largest section | W18: 396 words |
| Consultation rate | 100% (annotation impractical) |

The codebook is organized by window number. The scribe opens to the section for the current window and selects a word. Window 18 alone contains 396 words and produces ~50% of all corpus tokens, making it the production hub.

## 2. Lattice Structure

The manuscript's text is generated by traversing a 50-window lattice containing 7717 unique words.

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Windows | 50 |
| Vocabulary | 7717 words |
| Window size range | 18-396 words |
| Transition type | First-order Markov at window level |
| Canonical admissibility | 64.94% (corrected + suffix recovery) |
| Overgeneration | ~20x at all n-gram orders |
| Branching factor | 761.7 candidates per position (9.57 effective bits) |

Each word in the codebook maps to a specific next window. When the scribe writes a word, the lattice determines which window to consult next. The per-window correction offset adjusts for systematic drift in the device.

## 3. Production Protocol

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Procedure

**Step 1: INITIALIZE**
: Begin a new line. Set current_window to the window of the previous line's last word, or W18 if starting a new page.

**Step 2: READ STATE**
: Consult the tabula card to read the current window number and its correction offset.

**Step 3: LOOK UP VOCABULARY**
: Open the codebook to the section for the current window. All admissible words for this position are listed there.

**Step 4: SELECT WORD**
: Choose a word from the current window's vocabulary list. Selection is influenced by scribal preference (hand-specific suffix bias and frequency habits).

**Step 5: WRITE WORD**
: Inscribe the chosen word on the manuscript page.

**Step 6: ADVANCE STATE**
: Look up the written word in the lattice map to determine the raw next window number.

**Step 7: APPLY CORRECTION**
: Add the per-window correction offset to the raw window number (modulo 50) to get the corrected next window. This accounts for the device's systematic drift.

**Step 8: REPEAT**
: Return to step 2 with the new current_window. Continue until the line is complete.

### 3.2 Interruption Handling

| Event | Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| LINE BREAK | The current window carries over to the next line. No state reset occurs. |
| PAGE BREAK | The current window MAY reset to W18 (the hub) or carry over. Empirically, W18 dominates all folio starts (100% of 101 folios). |
| SECTION TRANSITION | No device reconfiguration. All sections use the same 50-window lattice and codebook. Thematic variation arises from vocabulary selection within windows, not different device states. |
| SCRIBAL ERROR (SLIP) | The scribe mis-indexes the codebook or misreads the tabula, producing a word from the wrong window. Slips concentrate at W18 (92.6% of observed slips) because W18 has the largest codebook section (396 words across 7+ pages). |

## 4. Scribal Variation

Two scribal hands operate the same device with different fluency profiles:

| Dimension | Hand 1 (f1-66) | Hand 2 (f75-84, f103-116) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Tokens | 9821 | 16108 |
| Vocabulary | 3664 | 4084 |
| Drift admissibility | 56.1% | 64.5% |
| Dominant suffix | -dy | -in |
| Window distribution | JSD=0.012, cosine=0.998 (identical) | Same device |
| Vocabulary overlap | 15.6% shared types (but 66-72% shared token coverage) | |

Both hands traverse the same lattice with the same window distribution. They differ in word selection preferences, suffix habits, and adherence to drift rules. Hand 2 follows the device more accurately (64.5% vs 56.1% admissibility).

## 5. Per-Section Production Profiles

| Section | Folios | Tokens | Words/Line | Lines/Folio | Drift Adm | Top Window |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| Herbal A | 55 | 8826 | 6.2 | 25.7 | 0.3705 | W18 (46%) |
| Herbal B | 3 | 1164 | 6.4 | 60.7 | 0.3192 | W18 (39%) |
| Astro | 7 | 2869 | 3.9 | 104.9 | 0.2984 | W18 (36%) |
| Biological | 10 | 6422 | 7.0 | 91.7 | 0.5688 | W18 (60%) |
| Cosmo | 2 | 1727 | 9.2 | 94.0 | 0.5827 | W18 (61%) |
| Pharma | 12 | 3501 | 5.6 | 52.2 | 0.5034 | W18 (54%) |
| Stars | 12 | 10096 | 9.3 | 90.4 | 0.4179 | W18 (49%) |

All sections use the same device and codebook. Thematic variation arises from vocabulary selection within windows, not from different device configurations.

## 6. Error Model

### 6.1 Mechanical Slips

- **Detected:** 202 vertical offset errors
- **Density:** 3.93% of lines
- **W18 concentration:** 92.6% of observed slips
- **Mechanism:** Scribe mis-indexes the codebook, producing a word from an adjacent window. W18's codebook section (396 words, 7+ pages) is the largest, making indexing errors most likely there.

### 6.2 Drift Violations

~35% of token transitions are not admissibly reached under the canonical model. The residual is frequency-dominated:

| Frequency Tier | Failure Rate | Share of All Failures |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Common (>100 occ.) | 6.9% | 6.8% |
| Medium (10-100) | 35.1% | 25.9% |
| Rare (<10) | 84.5% | 55.8% |
| Hapax (1 occ.) | 97.8% | 11.5% |

### 6.3 Vocabulary Frequency

- **Total word types:** 7717
- **Hapax (frequency=1):** 5282 (68.4%)
- **Rare (<10 occurrences):** 7237 (93.8%)

### 6.4 Hand-Specific Error Rates

| Hand | Admissibility | Drift Param | Dominant Suffix |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Hand 1 | 56.1% | 15 | -dy |
| Hand 2 | 64.5% | 25 | -in |

## 7. Steganographic Bandwidth

- **Realized bandwidth:** 7.53 bits per word
- **Admissible decisions:** 12519
- **Total capacity:** 11.5 KB (~22979 Latin characters)

The lattice provides sufficient bandwidth for sparse encoding (confirmed by Latin Vulgate encoding test: RSB = 2.21 bpw). However, high-density natural language is structurally unlikely given the entropy profile. The model bounds capacity but cannot prove absence of hidden content.

## 8. Historical Context

The reconstructed production system has direct parallels:

| System | Date | State Device | Reference | Similarity |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Alberti cipher | 1467 | 120mm disc (24 positions) | External alphabet | State tracker + codebook |
| Trithemius steganography | 1499 | Key table | Word codebook | Tabula + codebook |
| Llull Ars Magna | c.1305 | 200mm disc (9-16 positions) | Concept tables | Combinatorial state tracker |
| **Voynich production tool** | **c.1400-1450** | **170x160mm tabula (50 windows)** | **154pp codebook** | **State tracker + codebook** |

The Voynich system is most similar to Trithemius's steganographic architecture: a flat reference table (tabula) paired with a vocabulary codebook organized by state. The key difference is scale — 50 states and 7,717 words versus Trithemius's simpler key tables.

## 9. What This Does Not Tell You

- **Author intent:** The model is agnostic. Medical reference, philosophical exercise, hoax, and devotional artifact could all produce this structure.
- **Whether meaning exists:** 7.53 bits/word is sufficient for sparse encoding. The model bounds capacity but cannot prove absence.
- **Physical survival:** The model specifies functional requirements. Whether a specific artifact survives is an archaeological question.
- **The residual:** ~35% of transitions are unexplained. If structured, the residual could carry information the model does not capture.
