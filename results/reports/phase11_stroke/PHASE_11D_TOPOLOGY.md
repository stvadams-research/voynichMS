# Phase 11D: Stroke Topology Analysis

**Generated:** 2026-02-20T21:21:51.618857
**Status:** Scale-Specific Machine Detected

## 1. Executive Summary
This analysis applies the Phase 5 'Fractal Lattice Test' to the sub-glyph scale. By treating words as 'lines' and stroke feature-classes as 'tokens', we measured whether the manuscript's combinatorial logic is recursive (fractal) or restricted to the token level.

## 2. Quantitative Results

### 2.1 Sub-Glyph Metrics (Stroke Scale)
- **Collision Rate:** 0.0032
- **Gini Coefficient (Skew):** 0.4608
- **Avg Successor Convergence:** 12.3333

### 2.2 Hierarchical Correlation (Word vs. Stroke)
Comparing these results to the word-level 'Implicit Lattice' identified in Phase 5:

| Metric | Word Scale (P5) | Stroke Scale (P11) | Similarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| collision_rate | 0.1359 | 0.0032 | 2.4% |
| gini_coefficient | 0.6098 | 0.4608 | 75.6% |
| avg_successor_convergence | 2.2330 | 12.3333 | 18.1% |

**Average Hierarchical Similarity:** 32.0%

## 3. Epistemic Determination

The analysis yields a **NEGATIVE** for a recursive production mechanism. The 'machine' logic identified in Phase 5 is highly scale-dependent, operating as a deliberative combinatorial system at the word level but failing to manifest in the stroke-level generation of characters.

This strongly suggests that the scribe was consciously selecting tokens (words) to satisfy a lattice of constraints, rather than producing characters through a recursive algorithmic process. The lattice is a property of the **message channel**, not the **physical act of writing**.
