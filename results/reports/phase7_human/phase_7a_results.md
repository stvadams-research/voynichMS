# PHASE 7A RESULTS: HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS

## Correction and Uncertainty Density

- **Correction Count:** 768
- **Uncertainty Count:** 429
- **Density:** 14.93 corrections per 100 lines.

## Fatigue and Drift Analysis

- **Line Length Correlation:** -0.2921
- **Word Length Correlation:** -0.0249
  - *Interpretation:* A negative correlation would suggest fatigue (shorter lines/words as the page progresses).

## Production Effort Proxies

- **Mean Strokes per Character:** 1.70
- **Total Estimated Strokes:** 356,109
- **Sustained Effort:** The manuscript represents approximately 0.36 million distinct mechanical pen strokes.

## Final Determination

- **Visible Fatigue:** Measurable drift detected, suggesting a more standard or episodic production mode.
