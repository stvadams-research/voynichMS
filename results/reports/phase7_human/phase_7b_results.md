# PHASE 7B RESULTS: CODICOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS

## Page Boundary and Layout Adaptation

- **Line Length Position Correlation:** -0.1114
- **Boundary Effect Detected:** False
- **Layout Coefficient of Variation:** 0.4319
  - *Interpretation:* A correlation suggests in-situ adaptation (H7B.1).

## Quire Continuity

- **Between-Quire Variance (Mean Word Len):** 0.390327
- **Number of Quires Analyzed:** 26

## Scribal Hand Coupling

- **Hand 2:** Mean TTR = 0.6683 (n=44 pages)
- **Hand 1:** Mean TTR = 0.8551 (n=115 pages)

## Illustration Proximity Evidence Grade

- **Status:** CONCLUSIVE_NO_COUPLING
- **H1.4 Closure Lane:** H1_4_QUALIFIED
- **H1.5 Closure Lane:** H1_5_BOUNDED
- **Robustness Class:** MIXED
- **Entitlement Robustness Class:** ROBUST
- **Interpretation:** Confirmatory coupling phase2_analysis did not detect a robust illustration/layout coupling signal in entitlement lanes, robustness remains qualified across registered lanes, and diagnostic lanes remain non-conclusive monitoring signals; no claim is allowed beyond bounded entitlement scope.
- **Allowed Claim:** No robust image/layout coupling signal was detected under the configured adequacy and phase4_inference criteria.

## Final Determination

- **H7B.2 Supported:** Lack of significant boundary adaptation suggests the text may have been copied from an external source.
- **Illustration-Coupling Guardrail:** Confirmatory coupling phase2_analysis did not detect a robust illustration/layout coupling signal in entitlement lanes, robustness remains qualified across registered lanes, and diagnostic lanes remain non-conclusive monitoring signals; no claim is allowed beyond bounded entitlement scope.
