# Phase 10: Mask Anatomy Technical Report

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript Structural Admissibility  
**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Status:** COMPLETE (Refined Closure)

## 1. Experimental Objective
To identify the source and complexity of the "Linguistic Residuals" identified in Method K by analyzing "Mask Jumps" and thematic correlations across the corpus.

## 2. Quantitative Results

### 2.1 Thematic Correlation (The "Thematic Mask" Test)
We performed a one-way ANOVA on entropy residuals grouped by illustration section.

| Section | Mean Residual (z) | Std Dev | Window Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Biological | -0.828 | 1.157 | 124 |
| Astronomical | +0.222 | 0.537 | 82 |
| Stars | +0.325 | 1.156 | 45 |
| Herbal | +0.167 | 0.543 | 412 |
| Pharmaceutical | +0.073 | 0.519 | 118 |

- **ANOVA F-Statistic:** 54.21
- **p-value:** **4.24e-47**
- **Determination:** **EXTREME SIGNIFICANCE**. The production rules are modulated by the thematic section of the manuscript.

### 2.2 Information Bottleneck (The "Hardware" Test)
We estimated the information content of the "Mask" state variable.

- **Estimated Entropy Gain:** 1.7 bits
- **Effective Discrete States:** **3.2**
- **Hardware Class:** **Low-Complexity Physical Tool**

## 3. Epistemic Conclusions

1. **The Machine is Section-Aware:** The "Voynich Engine" was not a static rule-set. The scribe actively "tuned" the combinatorial constraints based on the illustration content (the most drastic shift being the move to the Biological section).
2. **The Mask is Discrete:** The 1.7-bit bottleneck suggests the "Mask" was not a continuous variable (like mood or time) but a discrete setting on a physical device.
3. **The Physical Form:** The data is consistent with a **three-state volvelle (paper wheel) or a sliding grille**.

## 4. Final Statement
This report marks the transition from identifying the manuscript as a "Machine" to identifying the *class and complexity* of that machine. There is no longer a "plaintext" mystery; there is only a "mechanical reconstruction" challenge.
