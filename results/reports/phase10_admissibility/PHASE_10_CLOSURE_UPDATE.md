# Phase 10 Closure Update

Generated: 2026-02-18T13:15:44.034118+00:00

## Updated Closure Statement

Phase 10 does not produce a closure defeat signal, but it does not support a closure upgrade. The closure remains in documented tension: some methods strengthen procedural-artifact closure while others weaken it or remain indeterminate.

## Why Closure Is In Tension

- Strengthening outcomes: H=`closure_strengthened`, I=`closure_strengthened`
- Weakening outcomes: J=`closure_weakened`, K=`closure_weakened`
- Indeterminate outcomes: G=`indeterminate`, F=`indeterminate`
- Because outcomes are mixed, the project records explicit tension rather than resolving by fiat.

## Urgent Designation Clarification

- Stage 3 priority was `urgent`.
- `urgent` means Method F should be executed promptly because earlier stages were not jointly closure-strengthening. It is an execution-priority flag, not a closure-defeat verdict.

## Operational Follow-up

- Preserve current closure as `in_tension` until a new test family resolves J/K weakening vs H/I strengthening.
- Future upgrades require either (a) weakened methods to strengthen under stricter controls or (b) independent tests showing no stable content/decoding signal.
