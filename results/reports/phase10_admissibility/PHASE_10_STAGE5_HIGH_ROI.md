Generated: 2026-02-18T14:27:55.565721+00:00
Run ID: 5f85586d-01fc-30c0-61f8-0f34e003c82a

## Gate Outcomes

- Method F robustness gate pass: `True`
- Method J strict gate pass (stays weakened): `True`
- Method K strict gate pass (stays weakened): `False`
- Resolution class: `partial_resolution_inconclusive`

## Method F Matrix

- Robustness runs completed: `12`
- Runs with weakened family decisions: `0`
- Runs violating stable-natural cap: `0`

## Resolution Rule

- Pre-registered rule: closure upgrade is only eligible if Method F passes and both Method J and Method K fail strict weakened-status gates.
- Rule satisfied: `False`
- Recommendation: `One weakened method persists; collect an independent adjudicating test family.`
