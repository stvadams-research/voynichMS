# Phase 10 Stage 1 Results (Methods H/J/K)

Generated: 2026-02-18T05:37:54.026363+00:00
Stage decision: **closure_weakened**

## Method Decisions

- Method H (Writing System Typology): `closure_strengthened`
- Method J (Steganographic Extraction): `closure_weakened`
- Method K (Residual Gap Anatomy): `closure_weakened`

## Artifacts

- Method H artifact: `results/data/phase10_admissibility/method_h_typology.json`
- Method J artifact: `results/data/phase10_admissibility/method_j_steganographic.json`
- Method K artifact: `results/data/phase10_admissibility/method_k_residual_gap.json`
- Stage 1 summary artifact: `results/data/phase10_admissibility/stage1_summary.json`
- Restart status tracker: `results/data/phase10_admissibility/stage1_execution_status.json`

## Restart Guidance

- The status tracker records completion per method and can be used to resume safely.
- Re-running the Stage 1 script skips completed methods unless `--force` is provided.
