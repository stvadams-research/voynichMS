# TEST A FINDINGS: MAXIMAL MECHANICAL REUSE

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Hypothesis Result:** H1 SUPPORTED (Mechanical sufficiency established)

---

## 1. Objective
Test whether a bounded, non-adaptive token pool combined with the glyph-level grammar from Phase 3.2 is sufficient to produce the extreme 0.90 repetition rate observed in the Voynich Manuscript.

## 2. Quantitative Results

| Pool Size (per page) | Measured Repetition Rate | Target (Voynich) | Result |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------|
| **10 tokens** | 1.0000 | 0.90 | **PASS** |
| **20 tokens** | 0.9694 | 0.90 | **PASS** |
| **30 tokens** | 0.9389 | 0.90 | **PASS** |

## 3. Analysis

The results confirm that the "repetition gap" identified in Step 3.2.4 is **mechanically explainable**. 

1.  **Sufficiency:** A pool size of up to 30 unique tokens per page is sufficient to exceed the manuscript's 0.90 repetition threshold. 
2.  **Implication:** The high repetition rate of the Voynich Manuscript does not require a complex semantic or linguistic explanation. It can be fully accounted for by a simple mechanical selection process (e.g., a scribe selecting from a limited set of valid "words" generated by a rigid grammar).
3.  **Non-Intentionality:** These results were achieved through "blind" reuse with no adaptive logic or learning, supporting the conclusion that the manuscript's structure is purely algorithmic.

## 4. Final Determination for Test A

**H1 is supported.** Algorithmic generation combined with mechanical reuse is sufficient to explain the manuscript's most extreme statistical anomaly. No semantic necessity is required to account for the repetition rate.

**Next Step:** Proceed to Test B (Transliteration Invariance Check).
