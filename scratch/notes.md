Option B: Phase 6 – External Anchoring Test

Goal:
Test whether entry-point distributions correlate with:

page boundaries,

illustration classes,

quire structure,

scribal hands.

This is not semantics. It is workflow anchoring.

Risk:
Requires careful control to avoid confirmation bias.

----------

Option C: Formal Closure

Goal:
Prove that, given:

deterministic traversal,

independent uniform entry,

large state space,

no further identification is possible from text alone.

This would be a positive impossibility result, which is extremely strong.

Risk:
Psychologically unsatisfying, but scientifically clean.
