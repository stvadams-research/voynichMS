a new class of inquiry (not a new phase)

This is not “Phase 3.2”.

This would be something like:

cognitive motor constraints

human production rhythm modeling

scribal training systems

ritualized or procedural writing behavior

embodied generation models

Notice what these have in common:

They are not “about the manuscript”

They are about humans producing constrained artifacts

They are interdisciplinary and speculative by nature

That is a different project, even if it uses your data.
