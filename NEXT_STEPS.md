# Next Steps

**Updated:** 2026-02-22

## Phase 17 — COMPLETE

- [x] **Blueprint generation** — Tabula card, palette plate, codebook index SVGs generated (volvelle rings deprecated to `historical/`)
- [x] **Operator protocol** — OPERATOR_MANUAL.md rewritten for tabula + codebook model (8-step protocol)
- [x] **Research monograph** — 3 new chapters (10a-10c), updated discussion + conclusion, all 3 publication profiles generated with zero missing references

## Cleanup — COMPLETE

- [x] Audit hardcoded `/reports/` paths in codebase — all paths correct (`results/reports/` prefix)
- [x] Phase 5 data cleanup — already clean (no `/data/qc/` exists, datasets properly named)
- [x] Final review of post-cleanup architecture — 7 missing `__init__.py` files added to `src/` submodules
- [x] Phase 1 report consolidation — no action needed (findings already in CANONICAL_EVALUATION + monograph ch. 3)
- [x] Phase 2 planning standardization — YAML frontmatter added to phase_2_3 and phase_2_4 execution plans; all 4 sub-phases confirmed COMPLETE

## Publication pipeline

- [ ] Validate replication process (fresh repo pull + `reproduce.yml`)
- [ ] Retag Zenodo repo + update documentation
- [ ] Publish to ResearchGate (pointer to Zenodo)
- [ ] Publish to arXiv

## Phase 20 loose ends — COMPLETE

- [x] 15-state merged volvelle deep characterization (Sprint 10: mathematical curiosity, not viable)
- [x] Volvelle-vs-tabula reconciliation note (CANONICAL_EVALUATION synthesis section)
- [x] Production workflow synthesis (Sprint 11: PRODUCTION_MODEL.md generated)
