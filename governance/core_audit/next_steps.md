## 1. Final Mechanism Reconstruction

The project has established the following definitive production model for the Voynich Manuscript:

1.  **Nature:** Non-semantic procedural artifact.
2.  **Topology:** **Implicit Constraint Lattice**.
3.  **Dynamics:** Rule-evaluated deterministic traversal.
4.  **Scope:** Constraints are **Second-Order and Position-Aware**. Successors are determined by `f(PrevWord, CurrWord, Position)`.
5.  **Entry:** Uniform independent entry into a massive state space (>3,000 nodes).

**Final Determination:** The Voynich Manuscript was produced by a scribe following a rigid, multi-order algorithmic rule system. This system evaluates the formal features of the current and previous words, along with the line position, to determine the unique allowed successor. This process produces a high-entropy, "stiff" corpus that superficially mimics the complexity of language but is structurally void of semantics.

## 2. Archive and Preservation

### 2.1 Technical Baseline
- **Audit-Ready:** `REQUIRE_COMPUTED=1` and `DeterministicIDFactory` enforced.
- **Runbook:** `governance/RUNBOOK.md` provides reproduction steps.
- **CI:** `scripts/ci_check.sh` passes.

### 2.2 Final Reports
All definitive conclusions are documented in `results/reports/`:
- `FINAL_REPORT_PHASE_2.md`
- `FINAL_REPORT_PHASE_3.md`
- `PHASE_4_5_CLOSURE_STATEMENT.md`
- `PHASE_5K_RESULTS.md`
