# Phase 7: Human Factors & Codicology

## Intent
Phase 7 bridges the gap between digital data and the physical object. We analyze the relationship between the text's algorithmic structure and the physical constraints of the vellum, ink, and folio layout.

## How to Replicate
Execute the standardized replication script:
```bash
python3 scripts/phase7_human/replicate.py
```

## Key Tests & Diagnostics
*   **Scribe Coupling**: Statistical mapping of mechanism stability across different identified "Hands."
*   **Page Boundary Analysis**: Investigates if the reset dynamics observed in Phase 5 correlate with physical folio boundaries.
*   **Quire Analysis**: Technical audit of quire-level consistency in the generative process.

## Expected Results
*   **Codicological Report**: A substantive Word document in `results/publication/phase7_report.docx`.
*   **Hand Stability Map**: Evidence showing that the production mechanism is invariant across different scribes, supporting a "Shared Tool" hypothesis.
