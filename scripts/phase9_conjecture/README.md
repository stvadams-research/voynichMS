# Phase 9: Conjecture & Implications

## Intent
Phase 9 provides a "Safe Space" for speculative interpretation now that the structural boundaries have been firmly established. It formalizes the "Algorithmic Glossolalia" hypothesis and defines the future of the field.

## How to Replicate
Execute the standardized replication script:
```bash
python3 scripts/phase9_conjecture/replicate.py
```

## Key Findings
- **Algorithmic Glossolalia**: The manuscript is a masterwork of cognitive engineering, intended to create a perfect, endless mystery.
- **Authorial Intent**: The creator is framed as an early pioneer of algorithmic art rather than a messenger.

## Expected Results
- **Final Research Statement**: A concluding report in `results/reports/phase9_conjecture/`.
- **Future Roadmap**: Technical suggestions for reconstructing the manuscript's production lattice.
