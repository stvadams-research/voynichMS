# Phase 8: Comparative Proximity

## Intent
Phase 8 places the Voynich Manuscript's structure in its historical and mathematical context. We measure the proximity of the Voynich "Implicit Lattice" to known 15th-century mechanical systems and modern synthetic artifacts.

## How to Replicate
Execute the standardized replication script:
```bash
python3 scripts/phase8_comparative/replicate.py
```

## Key Tests & Diagnostics
*   **Historical Proximity**: Quantitative comparison against Cardan Grilles, Lullian Wheels, and early steganographic methods.
*   **Semantic Proximity**: Measures the "Distance from Meaning" using normalized compression distance and cross-entropy.
*   **Uncertainty Sweep**: A final, high-iteration robustness check comparing the manuscript to every control dataset in the repository.

## Expected Results
*   **Comparative Report**: A substantive Word document in `results/publication/phase8_report.docx`.
*   **Proximity Matrix**: Data identifying which known historical artifacts most closely resemble the Voynich production process.
