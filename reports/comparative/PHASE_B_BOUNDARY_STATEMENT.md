## Phase B: Comparative and Contextual Classification

This statement defines the hard epistemic boundaries established by Phase B.

---

### 1. The Underdetermination Limit
Phase B demonstrates that while the Voynich Manuscript can be situated nearest to combinatorial systems, it remains **sui generis**. There is no "perfect match" in the recorded history of human formal artifacts.

### 2. Functional, Not Intentional
We have identified **what the text does** (exhausts states, follows rules, resets at boundaries) but Phase B proves that **why it does so** remains externally underdetermined.

### 3. Closure of Text-Internal Comparison
No further amount of statistical or structural comparison against natural languages or known ciphers will yield a closer match. The "Linguistic" and "Cipher" hypotheses are structurally distant outliers in this morphospace.

### 4. Required Evidence for Extension
To move beyond Phase B would require **new non-textual evidence** (e.g., physical discovery of tools, direct historical testimony) that is not contained within the manuscript itself.
