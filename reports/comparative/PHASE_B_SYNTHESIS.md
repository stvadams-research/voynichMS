## Phase B: Comparative and Contextual Classification

### Objective Summary
Phase B aimed to situate the Voynich Manuscript within the space of human-produced formal artifacts using non-semantic comparative metrics.

### Key Findings
1.  **Lullian Alignment (uncertainty-qualified):** Lullian-style systems remain the nearest point-estimate neighbor (Dist: 5.0990), but nearest-neighbor stability is moderate under perturbation.
2.  **Structural Isolation (uncertainty-qualified):** Voynich remains separated from natural-language and simple-table controls in point estimates, while comparative rank confidence is currently bounded by the uncertainty status.
3.  **Unique Profile:** Voynich's unique combination of **extreme reuse suppression** (Score 5) and **high history dependence** (Score 4) is not matched by any single artifact in the library.

### Comparison Results
- **Lullian Wheels:** Share VM's positional conditioning and reset dynamics but lack its memory (history dependence). Current distance CI is broad and nearest-neighbor stability is not yet high-confidence.
- **Magic Squares:** Share VM's sparsity and reuse suppression but are rigidly grid-locked.
- **Latin (Language):** Remains structurally distant in point estimate (Dist: 8.4853), with uncertainty interval still well above the nearest-neighbor cluster.

### Comparative Uncertainty Qualification
- This synthesis is explicitly **uncertainty-qualified**.
- Primary uncertainty artifact: `results/human/phase_7c_uncertainty.json`.
- Current nearest-neighbor stability, rank stability, and top-2 gap robustness are reported there and should gate claim strength.
- Current status from that artifact is `INCONCLUSIVE_UNCERTAINTY` with reason `TOP2_GAP_FRAGILE`; comparative claims remain directional and caveated.

### Non-Semantic Conclusion
The Voynich Manuscript behaves structurally like a **complex, memory-augmented combinatorial engine**. It belongs to the class of **formal, disciplined executions** where state-exhaustion and rule-adherence override communicative efficiency.

---

### Boundary Reassertion
- This phase does **not** claim the Voynich Manuscript *is* a Lullian device.
- It identifies Lullian-like combinatorial logic as the most statistically similar production mode.
- No semantic content has been inferred.

### Conditionally Closed Statement
Phase B has mapped the Voynich Manuscript into artifact space within the current comparative library and metric set. Further comparison against currently represented artifacts is unlikely to significantly reduce the remaining structural distance.

This conclusion is framework-bounded, uncertainty-qualified, and reopenable under the canonical criteria in `docs/REOPENING_CRITERIA.md`.

**Phase B remains conditionally bounded within the current framework, with closure status operationally contingent on gate-health recovery.**

### Operational Entitlement State
- Canonical operational entitlement source: `status/audit/release_gate_health_status.json`
- Current gate-health class: `GATE_HEALTH_DEGRADED`
- Under this state, closure and comparative claims remain operationally contingent and should be interpreted as qualified/reopenable rather than terminal.
