## Phase B: Comparative and Contextual Classification

### Objective Summary
Phase B aimed to situate the Voynich Manuscript within the space of human-produced formal artifacts using non-semantic comparative metrics.

### Key Findings
1.  **Lullian Alignment:** The nearest structural neighbor to the Voynich Manuscript is the **Lullian Wheel (Dist: 5.1)**, a combinatorial tool for generating permutations of states.
2.  **Structural Isolation:** Despite this proximity, the Voynich Manuscript remains **structurally isolated**. Even its closest neighbor is at a moderate distance, and it is significantly distant (Dist > 8) from natural language (Latin) and simple table-based generators (Rugg).
3.  **Unique Profile:** Voynich's unique combination of **extreme reuse suppression** (Score 5) and **high history dependence** (Score 4) is not matched by any single artifact in the library.

### Comparison Results
- **Lullian Wheels:** Share VM's positional conditioning and reset dynamics but lack its memory (history dependence).
- **Magic Squares:** Share VM's sparsity and reuse suppression but are rigidly grid-locked.
- **Latin (Language):** Falsified as a close neighbor (Dist: 8.5). Language is too redundant and lacks the extreme local resets found in Voynich.

### Non-Semantic Conclusion
The Voynich Manuscript behaves structurally like a **complex, memory-augmented combinatorial engine**. It belongs to the class of **formal, disciplined executions** where state-exhaustion and rule-adherence override communicative efficiency.

---

### Boundary Reassertion
- This phase does **not** claim the Voynich Manuscript *is* a Lullian device.
- It identifies Lullian-like combinatorial logic as the most statistically similar production mode.
- No semantic content has been inferred.

### Termination Statement
Phase B has successfully mapped the Voynich Manuscript into artifact space. Further comparison against known artifacts is unlikely to significantly reduce the remaining structural distance.

**Phase B is formally closed.**
