This document lists the selected artifacts for comparative analysis against the Voynich Manuscript.

---

### Inclusion Criteria
- Human-produced
- Formally constrained
- Non-optimized for communication
- Historically or ethnographically documented

### Final Selection (10 Artifacts)

| Artifact | Category | Role | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Classical Latin** | Natural Language | **Control** | Represents standard linguistic statistics. |
| **2. Table-Grille** | Non-Semantic Gen. | **Baseline** | Matches Phase 5 results; simple formal engine. |
| **3. Magic Squares** | Mathematical Seq. | **Core** | Pure algorithmic production; zero semantics. |
| **4. Vedic Chanting** | Oral Formalism | **Core** | High-discipline, rule-following, error-intolerant. |
| **5. Codex Seraphinianus** | Asemic Writing | **Core** | Modern formal artifact designed to look like a book. |
| **6. Lingua Ignota** | Constructed Lexicon | **Boundary** | Structured vocabulary without standard grammar. |
| **7. Trithemius Stegan.** | Formal Cryptography | **Core** | Strict rule-following to mask non-semantic text. |
| **8. Lullian Wheels** | Combinatorial Tool | **Core** | Mechanical permutation of states. |
| **9. Penmanship Drills** | Pedagogical | **Control** | Represents high-effort formal repetition. |
| **10. Enochian Tables** | Esoteric/Constructed | **Boundary** | Disciplined execution of a non-standard system. |

### Triaged Candidates (Exclusions)
- **Klingon:** Too optimized for communication (Language-like).
- **Zodiacal Tables:** Too small/sparse for full statistical comparison.
- **Random Noise:** Violates the "Human-Produced" and "Formally Constrained" rules.
