# SEMANTIC_LEAKAGE_CHECKLIST.md
## Phase B: Comparative and Contextual Classification

This checklist must be applied to every case file and claim made in Phase B to ensure adherence to the project's non-semantic mandate.

---

### Core Checks

- [ ] **No Content Assumption:** Does this claim assume what the text *means* or *is about*?
- [ ] **No Illustration Dependency:** Does this reliance on comparative illustrations assume their symbolic meaning?
- [ ] **No Efficiency Assumption:** Does this assume the scribe was trying to communicate clearly or briefly?
- [ ] **No Intent Attribution:** Does this attribute psychological or historical motives without structural evidence?
- [ ] **Structural Grounding:** Is every indicator based on measurable physical or statistical properties?
- [ ] **Neutral Language:** Does the description use formal terms (e.g., "successor," "state") instead of semantic ones (e.g., "word," "sentence")?
- [ ] **Falsifiability:** Could a different structural observation disprove this comparison?

### Binary Red-Line Violations

- **RE-ENTRY OF "CIPHER":** If the word "cipher" or "code" is used as an explanatory mechanism (rather than a comparative class), the claim is invalid.
- **RE-ENTRY OF "LANGUAGE":** If linguistic categories (e.g., "grammar," "vocabulary") are used to imply semantic production, the claim is invalid.
- **DECODING:** Any attempt to provide "example meanings" for symbols is strictly prohibited.
