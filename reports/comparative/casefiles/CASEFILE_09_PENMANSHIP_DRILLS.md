### 4. Structural Signatures (Scored 0–5)
| Dimension | Score | Evidence / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 5 | Total; repeat the same form exactly. |
| 2. Sparsity | 0 | None; maximum repetition of minimum states. |
| 3. Novelty Conv. | 0 | None; zero novelty. |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 0 | None; zero novelty density. |
| 5. Reuse Suppress. | 0 | None; repetition is the goal. |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 5 | Total; each line is a fresh start. |
| 7. Effort Proxy | 4 | High mechanical effort; low cognitive load. |
| 8. Correction Dens. | 1 | Low; simple repetition is hard to mess up. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 5 | Absolute; guided lines and grids. |
| 10. Global Stab. | 5 | Perfectly invariant. |
| 11. Positional Cond. | 0 | None; position is arbitrary. |
| 12. History Depend. | 0 | None; independent iterations. |

### 6. Summary and VM Distance
- **Key Alignment:** Reset Dynamics, Global Stability.
- **Key Deviation:** Sparsity, Novelty, Reuse Suppression (Everything else).
- **Estimated Proximity:** **Distant**
