### 4. Structural Signatures (Scored 0–5)
| Dimension | Score | Evidence / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Determinism | 5 | Perfect; static grids of letters. |
| 2. Sparsity | 2 | Low; uses a small alphabet in dense grids. |
| 3. Novelty Conv. | 5 | Perfect; fixed table sizes. |
| 4. Path Efficiency | 1 | Low; repetition is incidental to the grid. |
| 5. Reuse Suppress. | 0 | None; letters repeat within tables. |
| 6. Reset Dynamics | 5 | Total; each table is a closed unit. |
| 7. Effort Proxy | 4 | High cognitive load for extraction/masking. |
| 8. Correction Dens. | 3 | High; transcription errors are frequent. |
| 9. Layout Coupling | 5 | Absolute; the table is the object. |
| 10. Global Stab. | 5 | Invariant system. |
| 11. Positional Cond. | 5 | Total; position in grid = value. |
| 12. History Depend. | 0 | None; independent cells. |

### 6. Summary and VM Distance
- **Key Alignment:** Determinism, Positional Conditioning.
- **Key Deviation:** Sparsity, Reuse Suppression.
- **Estimated Proximity:** **Moderate**
