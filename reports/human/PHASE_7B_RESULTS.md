# PHASE 7B RESULTS: CODICOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS

## Page Boundary and Layout Adaptation

- **Line Length Position Correlation:** -0.1114
- **Boundary Effect Detected:** False
- **Layout Coefficient of Variation:** 0.4319
  - *Interpretation:* A correlation suggests in-situ adaptation (H7B.1).

## Quire Continuity

- **Between-Quire Variance (Mean Word Len):** 0.390327
- **Number of Quires Analyzed:** 26

## Scribal Hand Coupling

- **Hand 2:** Mean TTR = 0.6683 (n=44 pages)
- **Hand 1:** Mean TTR = 0.8551 (n=115 pages)

## Illustration Proximity Evidence Grade

- **Status:** INCONCLUSIVE_UNDERPOWERED
- **Interpretation:** Coupling analysis is underpowered or inferentially ambiguous; no conclusive claim is allowed.
- **Allowed Claim:** Current evidence is underpowered or ambiguous; no conclusive coupling claim is allowed.

## Final Determination

- **H7B.2 Supported:** Lack of significant boundary adaptation suggests the text may have been copied from an external source.
- **Illustration-Coupling Guardrail:** Coupling analysis is underpowered or inferentially ambiguous; no conclusive claim is allowed.
