# PHASE 7B RESULTS: CODICOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS

## Page Boundary and Layout Adaptation

- **Line Length Position Correlation:** -0.1114
- **Boundary Effect Detected:** False
- **Layout Coefficient of Variation:** 0.4319
  - *Interpretation:* A correlation suggests in-situ adaptation (H7B.1).

## Quire Continuity

- **Between-Quire Variance (Mean Word Len):** 0.390327
- **Number of Quires Analyzed:** 26

## Scribal Hand Coupling

- **Hand 2 (Currier B):** Mean TTR = 0.6683 (n=44 pages)
- **Hand 1 (Currier A):** Mean TTR = 0.8551 (n=115 pages)
- **Significance:** A delta of ~0.19 in token repetition rate across hands indicates that **execution is strongly coupled to the scribal agent**, despite the global mechanism remaining stable.

## Final Determination

- **Mixed Coupling Profile:**
  - **Geometric Coupling (Weak):** Lack of significant boundary adaptation (-0.11 correlation) supports **H7B.2 (External Generation/Copying)**.
  - **Scribal Coupling (Strong):** Extreme variance in execution signatures (TTR) across scribal hands indicates that while the text may be copied, the **scribe significantly modulates the formal system's instantiation**.
- **Synthesis:** The Voynich Manuscript appears to be the result of **multiple scribes independently executing or copying a formal system**, where the physical page geometry is secondary to the scribal production mode.
