# PHASE 6B RESULTS: EFFICIENCY AUDIT

## Quantitative Results

| Metric | Voynich (Real) | Indifferent (H6B.2) | Optimized (H6B.1) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Reuse Supp. Index | 0.9896 | 0.9901 | 0.9829 |
| Path Efficiency | 0.3227 | 0.1212 | 0.0050 |
| Redundancy Rate | 0.0159 | 0.1924 | 0.9845 |
| Comp. Ratio | 0.3425 | 0.3618 | 0.0729 |

## Analysis

- **Low Compressibility:** Voynich is significantly less compressible than an optimized system, supporting H6B.2.
- **High Reuse Suppression:** The system actively avoids repeating states despite potential cost, suggesting efficiency is not a priority.
