1. Focus on the unresolved ~35% transition gap with rare/hapax-specific modeling and stronger holdout stress tests; this is the most likely remaining analytical upside.

2. Physical validation path. Run blinded human/operator reproduction experiments from the tabula+codebook protocol and compare slip/usage distributions against predicted signatures.
