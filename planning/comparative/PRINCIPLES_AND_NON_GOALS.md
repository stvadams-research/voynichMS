## Voynich Project, Phase B, Comparative and Historical Extension

---

## High-Level Objective

The objective of Phase B is to situate the Voynich Manuscript within a broader space of human-produced formal artifacts by comparative analysis, without reintroducing semantic assumptions or attempting further mechanism narrowing from the text alone.

This phase explicitly begins after the exhaustion of text-only identifiability. It operates under a different evidentiary regime and accepts different risks, while preserving the epistemic boundaries established in earlier phases.

Phase B is not a continuation of decoding or mechanism discovery. It is a classification and contextualization effort focused on human practice rather than textual meaning.

## Core Principles

The following principles are invariant throughout Phase B.

### 1. Evidence-Class Separation

Phase B does not revisit text-only inference.

- No new claims about semantics, language, or encoding are permitted.
- The symbol stream is treated as a closed evidentiary domain whose inferential capacity is exhausted.
- All new claims must be grounded in non-textual or meta-textual evidence.

### 2. Non-Semantic Discipline

Semantic interpretation remains explicitly out of scope.

- Tokens are not assigned meaning.
- Sections are not labeled by presumed content.
- Analogies must not rely on what texts are “about.”

If semantic reasoning becomes necessary to sustain an argument, that argument is invalid.

### 3. Comparison Over Explanation

Phase B prioritizes proximity and difference, not causation.

- The goal is to identify structural neighbors, not origins.
- Analogues are used to bound plausibility, not to assert identity.
- No single comparison is treated as explanatory on its own.

### 4. Artifact-Centered Analysis

The Voynich Manuscript is treated as a physical and procedural artifact, not primarily as a message.

Primary focus includes:

- Production discipline and duration.
- Error tolerance and correction behavior.
- Relationship between execution and output.
- Degree of indifference to efficiency or communication.

### 5. Asymmetric Burden of Proof

Claims of similarity require positive evidence. Claims of difference default to caution.

- Superficial resemblance is insufficient.
- Absence of analogy is a valid outcome.
- Failure to classify is informative, not a deficiency.

## Explicit Non-Goals

Phase B does not attempt the following.

- Decoding, translation, or semantic recovery.
- Further narrowing of the generative mechanism class.
- Proving authorial intent.
- Establishing historical authorship or provenance beyond what is already known.
- Demonstrating that the manuscript “has meaning” or “has no meaning.”
- Rehabilitating cipher or language hypotheses under new terminology.

Any work that drifts toward these goals is out of scope.

## Key Research Questions

Phase B is structured around the following questions.

- What kinds of human activities produce long, disciplined, non-semantic formal artifacts?
- Under what institutional, ritual, cognitive, or pedagogical contexts do such artifacts arise?
- How common or rare are artifacts that prioritize correctness of execution over communicative value?
- Is the Voynich Manuscript structurally isolated even among non-semantic human practices?

These questions are descriptive and classificatory, not interpretive.

## Major Execution Steps (High-Level)

The phase proceeds through the following major steps. Each will be expanded into its own execution plan.

### Step 1. Define Comparison Dimensions

- Derive comparison axes from completed Voynich analysis.
- Ensure all dimensions are measurable without semantic assumptions.
- Examples include execution determinism, error tolerance, layout sensitivity, and efficiency indifference.

### Step 2. Assemble Candidate Artifact Classes

- Identify known human practices that generate formal artifacts without primary communicative intent.
- Exclude artifacts whose interpretation depends on semantic decoding.
- Treat this as hypothesis generation, not selection.

### Step 3. Comparative Scoring and Mapping

- Evaluate candidate artifacts against the defined dimensions.
- Document both alignments and divergences.
- Avoid collapsing distinct practices into a single category prematurely.

### Step 4. Structural Proximity Analysis

- Assess whether Voynich occupies an existing region of artifact space or remains isolated.
- Identify whether similarities are systemic or incidental.
- Explicitly track uncertainty and ambiguity.

### Step 5. Synthesis and Boundary Statement

- Summarize what Phase B adds and what it does not resolve.
- Reaffirm boundaries between comparison and interpretation.
- State clearly whether classification succeeded, failed, or remained indeterminate.

## Success Criteria

Phase B is considered successful if it achieves one or more of the following without violating prior constraints:

- Demonstrates that Voynich belongs to a sparse but real class of human formal artifacts.
- Sharpens understanding of what makes Voynich unusual even among non-semantic productions.
- Clarifies the human contexts in which such an artifact would be coherent to produce.
- Establishes that no strong comparative analogues exist, strengthening the case for isolation.

Success is not measured by explanatory closure.

---

## Failure Modes to Avoid

- Semantic leakage through analogy.
- Retrofitting historical narratives to fit the artifact.
- Treating comparison as explanation.
- Reopening exhausted text-only questions.
- Overweighting single analogues or anecdotal evidence.

---

## Phase Boundary Statement

Phase B begins only because Phase A demonstrated that no further narrowing is possible from the text alone.

Phase B ends when comparative analysis no longer produces meaningful constraint without interpretation.

Anything beyond that point belongs to a different project entirely.
