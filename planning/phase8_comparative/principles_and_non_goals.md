## Voynich Project, Phase B, Comparative and Contextual Classification

---

## Phase Context

Phase B begins **after the exhaustion of text-only phase4_inference**.

All claims established in Phases 1–7 remain invariant:
- The text stream has been fully exploited for structural and identifiability phase4_inference.
- No further narrowing of phase5_mechanism or semantics is possible from text alone.
- Any additional work must therefore operate under a **different evidentiary regime**.

Phase B is not a continuation of decoding.
It is a **new project** with different inputs, risks, and failure modes.

---

## High-Level Objective

The objective of Phase B is to **classify the Voynich Manuscript as a phase7_human-produced formal artifact** by comparison with other structured phase7_human artifacts, without reintroducing semantic interpretation or text-only phase4_inference.

Specifically, Phase B seeks to determine:

- Whether the Voynich Manuscript belongs to an existing class of phase7_human formal artifacts.
- Whether it occupies an intersection of multiple classes.
- Or whether it remains structurally isolated even under broad phase8_comparative phase2_analysis.

The goal is **proximity and differentiation**, not explanation or interpretation.

## Phase B Contract (Non-Negotiable)

### Evidence-Class Expansion

Phase B explicitly allows evidence **outside the symbol stream**, including:

- Codicology and material constraints.
- Scribal execution characteristics.
- Known phase7_human practices and artifact ecologies.
- Historically documented production contexts.
- Comparative artifacts with known purpose or usage.

### Evidence-Class Prohibitions

The following remain strictly out of scope:

- Semantic interpretation of Voynich tokens.
- Assigning meaning to words, glyphs, or sections.
- Decoding, translation, or cipher recovery.
- Any new phase4_inference based solely on Voynich text statistics.
- Retroactive historical narrative built to fit conclusions.

If an argument requires assuming what the text is “about,” it is invalid.

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Class Separation

The Voynich symbol stream is a **closed evidentiary domain**.

- No new claims about structure, phase5_mechanism, or semantics may be derived from it.
- All Phase B claims must be grounded in **phase8_comparative or contextual evidence**.

### 2. Non-Semantic Discipline

Phase B does not relax semantic quarantine.

- Tokens remain uninterpreted.
- Illustrations are not treated as semantic labels.
- Analogies must not rely on content similarity.

Semantic plausibility is not evidence.

### 3. Comparison, Not Explanation

Phase B compares artifacts; it does not explain Voynich.

- Similarity does not imply derivation.
- Analogy does not imply intent.
- Classification does not imply purpose.

The strongest admissible claim is “Voynich is closer to X than to Y along defined dimensions.”

### 4. Artifact-Centered Framing

Voynich is treated as an **executed object**, not a message.

Primary focus areas include:
- Execution determinism.
- Error tolerance and correction norms.
- Layout sensitivity vs indifference.
- Tool reliance or absence.
- Efficiency indifference.
- Human labor ecology.

### 5. Asymmetric Burden of Proof

- Claims of similarity require positive evidence.
- Claims of difference default to caution.
- Failure to find analogues is a valid and meaningful outcome.

Phase B is allowed to conclude that Voynich remains unclassifiable.

## Explicit Non-Goals

Phase B does **not** attempt to:

- Recover meaning, plaintext, or translation.
- Identify the author or historical origin beyond known facts.
- Argue that Voynich was intended to deceive.
- Rehabilitate cipher or language hypotheses under new labels.
- Narrow the generative phase5_mechanism class further.
- Infer purpose unless historically documented independent of Voynich.

Any drift toward these goals constitutes scope violation.

---

## Key Research Questions

Phase B addresses the following questions only:

- What kinds of phase7_human activities reliably produce long, disciplined, formally constrained artifacts without communicative optimization?
- Under what institutional, ritual, pedagogical, or cognitive contexts do such artifacts arise?
- How common are artifacts where correctness of execution dominates efficiency or intelligibility?
- Does the Voynich Manuscript resemble any known artifact ecologies along non-semantic dimensions?
- If not, in what ways is it structurally isolated?

These questions are classificatory, not interpretive.

## Major Execution Steps (Phase B)

Each step will be expanded into a separate execution plan.

### Step B1. Define Comparison Dimensions

- Derive dimensions from Phase 7 findings.
- Ensure each dimension is observable without semantic assumptions.
- Define scoring scales and confounds.
- Score Voynich first as the anchor reference.

### Step B2. Assemble Artifact Comparison Library

- Identify ca
