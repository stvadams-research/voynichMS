# PHASE_B_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
## Voynich Project, Phase B, Comparative and Contextual Classification

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **operational plan** for Phase B.

It translates the approved principles and non-goals into:
- Concrete workstreams
- Atomized tasks
- Clear execution order
- Explicit stopping conditions

This is not a research narrative.  
It is an execution blueprint.

---

## Phase B Objective (Operational)

To classify the Voynich Manuscript within the space of known phase7_human-produced formal artifacts using non-semantic, non-text-only phase8_comparative phase2_analysis, or to demonstrate that it remains structurally isolated even under broad comparison.

---

## Global Constraints (Reiterated)

All tasks must comply with:

- No semantic interpretation of Voynich text.
- No new text-only phase4_inference.
- No decoding, translation, or cipher hypotheses.
- All claims must be phase8_comparative, not explanatory.
- Failure to classify is an acceptable and informative outcome.

---

## Workstream Overview

Phase B is divided into five workstreams, executed mostly sequentially with limited overlap.

1. Boundary and Scoring Infrastructure
2. Artifact Library Construction
3. Case File Development
4. Comparative Mapping and Analysis
5. Synthesis and Closure

Each workstream contains atomized tasks with explicit deliverables.

---

## Workstream 1, Boundary and Scoring Infrastructure

### Objective
Create a stable comparison framework that prevents semantic drift and ad hoc reasoning.

### Deliverables
- `COMPARISON_DIMENSIONS.md`
- `SCORING_GUIDELINES.md`
- `SEMANTIC_LEAKAGE_CHECKLIST.md`

### Tasks

**B1.1 Define Comparison Dimensions**
- Enumerate 10–14 non-semantic dimensions.
- For each dimension:
  - Definition
  - Observable indicators
  - Excluded evidence
  - Known confounds

**B1.2 Define Scoring Scales**
- Choose a consistent scale (e.g. 0–3 or 0–5).
- Define what each score represents.
- Ensure scores can be assigned without interpretation.

**B1.3 Anchor Voynich Scores**
- Score the Voynich Manuscript on all dimensions.
- Treat this vector as fixed unless a boundary violation is found.
- Document uncertainty explicitly.

**B1.4 Create Semantic Leakage Checklist**
- Binary checks applied to every claim and case file.
- Example checks:
  - Does this assume what the text is about?
  - Does this rely on illustration interpretation?
  - Does this reintroduce efficiency or communication assumptions?

### Exit Criteria
- Voynich anchor vector is complete.
- All dimensions are testable and interpretable by a third party.

## Workstream 2, Artifact Library Construction

### Objective
Assemble a controlled comparison set spanning relevant phase7_human formal artifacts.

### Deliverables
- `ARTIFACT_LIBRARY.md`

### Tasks

**B2.1 Define Inclusion Criteria**
- Human-produced
- Formally constrained
- Non-optimized for communication
- Historically or ethnographically documented

**B2.2 Define Exclusion Criteria**
- Requires semantic decoding to function
- Purely random or purely decorative
- Modern digital systems without phase7_human execution analogues

**B2.3 Assemble Candidate List**
Target 15–25 candidates across categories:
- Ritual and performative texts
- Esoteric symbol systems
- Constructed languages and private scripts
- Algorithmic or template-assisted artifacts
- Pedagogical or training artifacts
- Aesthetic or asemic writing

**B2.4 Triage Candidates**
- Label each as:
  - Core comparison
  - Boundary case
  - Control or counterexample

### Exit Criteria
- Final library of ~10–12 artifacts selected for full case files.
- Rationale documented for each inclusion.

---

## Workstream 3, Case File Development

### Objective
Standardize evidence so comparisons are reproducible and auditable.

### Deliverables
- `CASEFILE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Individual case files under `/CASEFILES/`

### Tasks

**B3.1 Create Case File Template**
Each case file must include:
- Artifact description (non-interpretive)
- Known production constraints
- Execution ecology and phase7_human factors
- Layout dependence or indifference
- Tool or device reliance
- Error tolerance and correction norms
- Scored comparison dimensions
- Confounds and uncertainties

**B3.2 Pilot Case Files**
- Produce 2 pilot cases:
  - One structurally close candidate
  - One structurally distant control
- Validate rubric usability.

**B3.3 Full Case File Production**
- Complete remaining case files.
- Apply semantic leakage checklist to each.

### Exit Criteria
- All selected artifacts have complete case files.
- No unresolved rubric ambiguities remain.

---

## Workstream 4, Comparative Mapping and Analysis

### Objective
Determine structural proximity, clustering, or isolation.

### Deliverables
- `COMPARATIVE_MATRIX.md` or `.csv`
- `PROXIMITY_ANALYSIS.md`

### Tasks

**B4.1 Assemble Comparative Matrix**
- Rows: Voynich + all case files
- Columns: comparison dimensions
- Include uncertainty annotations.

**B4.2 Define Distance and Similarity Heuristics**
- Define what counts as:
  - Close
  - Moderate
  - Distant
- Predefine isolation criteria.

**B4.3 Analyze Clustering**
- Identify:
  - Nearest neighbors
  - Hybrid positions
  - Unique outliers

**B4.4 Stress-Test Results**
- Remove one dimension at a time.
- Check for instability or overfitting.
- Document sensitivity.

### Exit Criteria
- Comparative position of Voynich is stable under reasonable perturbations.

---

## Workstream 5, Synthesis and Closure

### Objective
Produce bounded conclusions without overreach.

### Deliverables
- `PHASE_B_SYNTHESIS.md`
- `PHASE_B_BOUNDARY_STATEMENT.md`

### Tasks

**B5.1 Draft Synthesis**
- What Phase B adds.
- What Phase B does not resolve.
- Where Voynich sits in artifact space.

**B5.2 Reassert Boundaries**
- Explicitly restate what cannot be inferred.
- Identify evidence that would be required to go further.

**B5.3 Decide Termination**
- Confirm that further comparison would not add constraint.
- Formally close Phase B.

### Exit Criteria
- Clear, defensible stopping point.
- No open-ended exploratory threads.

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Actionable Now)

1. Create `COMPARISON_DIMENSIONS.md`.
2. Score Voynich on all dimensions.
3. Draft `CASEFILE_TEMPLATE.md`.
4. Select and document two pilot artifacts.
5. Write two pilot case files.

These five steps unblock the entire phase.

---

## Final Note

Phase B is not about being right.
It is about being **finished correctly**.

The strongest possible outcome is not a classification,
but a demonstrated limit on classification itself.
