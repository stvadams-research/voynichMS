## Phase 2 – Analysis and Inference Layer

This document defines the binding principles and explicit non-goals governing Phase 2 of the Voynich project.

Phase 2 exists because Phase 1 succeeded.
Its purpose is to work on top of a frozen phase1_foundation without weakening it.

This document is normative, not descriptive.
If work conflicts with this document, the work is wrong.

## 1. Phase 2 Mission Statement

Phase 2 exists to:

- evaluate which classes of explanation are admissible given the surviving evidence
- stress-test interpretations under explicit constraints
- narrow the space of plausible explanations without asserting meaning

Phase 2 does not exist to:
- solve the Voynich Manuscript
- translate the manuscript
- confirm a favored theory

---

## 2. Relationship to Phase 1 (Foundation)

Phase 1 is complete and frozen.

Phase 2:
- depends on Phase 1 outputs
- must not reinterpret Phase 1 artifacts
- must not modify Phase 1 data, schemas, or decisions

Phase 1 answers:
What structure exists, honestly?

Phase 2 answers:
What explanations are allowed to exist, honestly?

---

## 3. Core Principles

### Principle 1: Foundation Immutability

All Phase 1 artifacts are immutable.

This includes:
- ledgers
- anchors
- controls
- metrics
- decision records
- provenance data

Phase 2 may read these artifacts.
Phase 2 may not rewrite their meaning.

---

### Principle 2: Admissibility Before Truth

Phase 2 evaluates whether an explanation is permitted, not whether it is correct.

Claims must be framed as:
- admissible
- inadmissible
- underconstrained

Never as:
- true
- false
- decoded

---

### Principle 3: Explicit Assumptions

Every Phase 2 phase2_analysis must declare:
- what it assumes
- what it ignores
- what would falsify it

Implicit assumptions are violations.

---

### Principle 4: Competing Explanations Are Required

Phase 2 work must consider:
- linguistic explanations
- non-linguistic explanations
- mixed or hybrid systems

Work that evaluates only one explanation class is incomplete.

---

### Principle 5: Controls Are First-Class Citizens

All Phase 2 analyses must:
- reuse Phase 1 controls
- introduce additional controls where appropriate
- report failures prominently

Controls are not a formality.
They are the primary evidence.

---

### Principle 6: No Semantic Commitment

Phase 2 may reason about:
- structure
- constraints
- regularities
- impossibilities

Phase 2 may not:
- assign meaning
- label semantics
- propose translations as conclusions

Semantic hypotheses belong after admissibility is established.

---

### Principle 7: Reversibility

All Phase 2 work must be:
- modular
- removable
- non-destructive

If removing an phase2_analysis breaks the system, it violated this principle.

---

## 4. What Counts as Progress in Phase 2

Progress is defined as:

- ruling out explanation classes
- tightening admissibility constraints
- identifying structural impossibilities
- clarifying what cannot be claimed

Progress is not defined as:
- partial translations
- compelling narratives
- visual similarity arguments
- intuition-backed claims

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals

Phase 2 explicitly does NOT aim to:

- translate the manuscript
- identify the language
- identify the author or origin
- assign semantic labels to glyphs or diagrams
- optimize machine learning models for prediction
- produce a publishable interpretation

If any of the above occurs, it is accidental and must be treated skeptically.

---

## 6. Handling Ambiguity

Ambiguity is not a defect.

Phase 2 must:
- preserve ambiguity where evidence is insufficient
- resist forced resolution
- prefer underclaiming to overclaiming

Ambiguity that survives strong constraints is information.

---

## 7. Interaction with Hypotheses

Hypotheses in Phase 2:

- are exploratory
- must be falsifiable
- must compete with alternatives
- may fail without being wrong

Hypotheses are tools, not commitments.

---

## 8. Termination Conditions

Phase 2 work on a topic should stop when:

- further refinement does not reduce admissible explanations
- results become sensitive to ungrounded assumptions
- controls dominate observed effects

Stopping is not failure.
It is signal.

---

## 9. Violations and Corrections

If Phase 2 work is found to violate these principles:

- the violation must be documented
- the work must be revised or discarded
- no exception is made for effort or elegance

Integrity outweighs productivity.

---

## 10. Final Statement

Phase 2 is where interpretation becomes tempting.

These principles exist to ensure that:
- interpretation remains constrained
- disagreement remains possible
- future work remains honest

If Phase 2 feels uncomfortable, it is working.

This document is binding for all Phase 2 contributors.
