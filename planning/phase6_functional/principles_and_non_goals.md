## Phase 6 — Functional Differentiation Under a Frozen Mechanism

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript, Structural Admissibility Program  
**Phase:** 6  
**Status:** Pre-registered framing document  
**Purpose:** Explicitly define what Phase 6 is allowed to do, what it is not allowed to do, and the principles that govern all subsequent Phase 6 work.

---

## 1. Phase 6 Position in the Program

Phase 6 begins **after** internal structural identifiability has been completed (Phases 1–5K).

At the start of Phase 6, the following are treated as **fixed results**, not hypotheses:

- The manuscript’s internal production mechanism is identified as a  
  **deterministic, rule-evaluated constraint system (implicit lattice)**.
- Lines are independent traversal instances with strict boundary resets.
- Entry points are independent and drawn from a very large state space.
- Successor constraints depend on **position and immediate history**.
- No text-internal evidence supports semantics or language.
- All competing internal mechanism classes have been eliminated.

Phase 6 does **not** revisit, weaken, or reopen any Phase 5 conclusions.

---

## 2. Phase 6 Core Intent

Phase 6 shifts the question from:

> “What mechanism produced the manuscript?”

to:

> “What *functional role* best explains the construction and execution of this identified mechanism, under testable criteria?”

This is a **change in intent**, not a change in rigor.

Phase 6 investigates *function*, not *meaning*.

---

## 3. Governing Principles

All Phase 6 work must satisfy the following principles.

### 3.1 Mechanism Freeze Principle
The identified mechanism from Phase 5 is **frozen**.

- No new mechanism classes may be introduced.
- No eliminated class may be revived.
- No hybridization with semantic or linguistic models is permitted.

Phase 6 assumes *how* the manuscript was generated is known.

---

### 3.2 Testability Requirement
Every Phase 6 hypothesis must make **distinct, falsifiable, structural predictions**.

Disallowed:
- narratives that cannot be falsified,
- claims about intent without observable consequences,
- explanations that “fit anything”.

Allowed:
- predictions about coverage, redundancy, error structure,
- optimization vs inefficiency signatures,
- adversarial sensitivity,
- usage vs exhaustion patterns.

---

### 3.3 Non-Semantic Discipline
Phase 6 does **not** assume or search for meaning.

Specifically prohibited:
- translation attempts,
- semantic glosses,
- symbolic interpretation of glyphs or diagrams,
- claims that meaning exists “but is hidden”.

If meaning is invoked, it must be:
- external to the text, and
- explicitly labeled as a new assumption (outside Phase 6 scope).

---

### 3.4 Function Over Intention
Phase 6 evaluates **functional classes**, not mental states.

Phase 6 asks:
- What does this system *do*?
- What constraints does its structure optimize for?

Phase 6 does **not** ask:
- What did the author believe?
- What did the author intend to communicate?
- What cultural symbolism motivated it?

---

### 3.5 Negative Results Are Valid Outcomes
Phase 6 is allowed to conclude that:
- multiple functional classes remain compatible, or
- further narrowing requires external evidence.

Phase 6 is **not obligated** to produce a single surviving function.

---

## 4. Allowed Hypothesis Classes (High-Level)

Phase 6 limits itself to **systematically testable functional categories**, including but not limited to:

- **Formal-System Execution**  
  The manuscript exists to instantiate or exhaust a formal rule system.

- **Operational Tool / Generator**  
  The manuscript functions as infrastructure for producing or regulating other outputs.

- **Adversarial / Epistemic Stress Artifact**  
  The manuscript is tuned to trigger false inference while resisting correct interpretation.

These are **functional roles**, not interpretations of meaning.

Sub-phases (e.g., 6A, 6B, 6C) may each focus on one class.

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals

Phase 6 explicitly does **not** aim to:

- determine what the manuscript “says”,
- identify a language, cipher, or code,
- infer the author’s beliefs, intentions, or identity,
- reconstruct historical usage without external evidence,
- explain illustrations symbolically,
- assert religious, mystical, or cultural significance.

Any work pursuing those goals is outside Phase 6 and must be labeled as a separate project.

---

## 6. Evidence Scope

### 6.1 Permitted Evidence
- Text-internal structure (new analyses allowed)
- Error patterns and deviations
- Coverage and redundancy metrics
- Distributional inefficiencies
- Sensitivity to perturbation
- Layout-independent structural effects

### 6.2 Restricted Evidence
- Codicological or historical data may be referenced **only** if:
  - treated as external constraints, and
  - not used to infer meaning.

---

## 7. Termination Criteria

Phase 6 terminates when one of the following is reached:

1. A single functional class is strongly supported and others eliminated.
2. Multiple functional classes remain compatible and the boundary is documented.
3. Further discrimination is shown to require assumptions or evidence outside the program’s scope.

Phase 6 does **not** continue indefinitely.

---

## 8. Phase 6 Integrity Statement

Phase 6 maintains the epistemic discipline established in Phases 1–5 by:

- freezing internal mechanism identification,
- restricting itself to testable functional hypotheses,
- explicitly separating structure from meaning,
- and documenting all assumptions.

Phase 6 exists to explore *why this mechanism might exist*, **without pretending the text itself answers that question**.

---

**Document Status:** Frozen  
**Next:** Define Phase 6A execution plan (Formal-System Exhaustion)
