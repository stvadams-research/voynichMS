## Phase 2 – Admissibility, Stress Testing, and Constrained Inference

This roadmap defines the **authoritative plan** for Phase 2 of the Voynich project.

Phase 2 begins only because Phase 1 (Foundation) is complete and frozen.
Phase 2 is allowed to take interpretive risk, but only within strict constraints.

This roadmap is binding.
Work that does not map to this roadmap is out of scope.

---

## 1. Phase 2 Objectives

Phase 2 exists to:

- determine which classes of explanation are admissible given Phase 1 evidence
- stress-test translation feasibility without attempting translation
- evaluate non-linguistic and hybrid system models
- explicitly rule out explanations where possible

Phase 2 does NOT exist to:
- translate the manuscript
- assert semantic meaning
- produce a definitive theory

---

## 2. Phase 2 Structure Overview

Phase 2 is organized into **three parallel but coordinated tracks**:

- Track A: Admissibility Mapping
- Track B: Constrained Translation Stress Tests
- Track C: Alternative System Modeling

Each track produces structured outputs that can:
- constrain the others
- invalidate assumptions
- or terminate entire lines of inquiry

No track has priority by default.

---

## 3. Track A – Admissibility Mapping

### 3.1 Purpose

To determine which *classes of explanation* are structurally permitted by the evidence.

This track answers:
“What kinds of systems could this be?”

---

### 3.2 Explanation Classes to Evaluate

At minimum:

- Natural language
- Enciphered language
- Constructed symbolic system
- Visual or diagrammatic grammar
- Hybrid or layered systems

Additional classes may be proposed, but must be justified.

---

### 3.3 Required Outputs

For each explanation class:

- Explicit admissibility criteria
- Phase 1 structures that support admissibility
- Phase 1 structures that argue against admissibility
- Degree of underconstraint

Outputs must be comparative and symmetrical.
No explanation class receives special treatment.

---

### 3.4 Stop Conditions

Stop evaluation of an explanation class when:

- it violates Phase 1 constraints
- it requires rejected structures
- it becomes unfalsifiable

---

## 4. Track B – Constrained Translation Stress Tests

### 4.1 Purpose

To test whether *translation is even structurally possible* under surviving constraints.

This track does NOT attempt decoding.

---

### 4.2 Permitted Stress Tests

Examples include:

- substitution system feasibility under glyph variability
- positional constraint testing (line, region, anchor locality)
- vocabulary growth constraints
- word length and repetition bounds

All tests must be framed as:
“Would translation be possible if…”

---

### 4.3 Required Outputs

- Feasibility envelopes
- Structural contradictions (if found)
- Explicit failure modes

Partial success is not success.
Inconclusive outcomes must be recorded as such.

---

### 4.4 Stop Conditions

Stop when:

- constraints forbid translation classes
- remaining possibilities are underdetermined
- results become sensitive to unjustified assumptions

---

## 5. Track C – Alternative System Modeling

### 5.1 Purpose

To evaluate non-linguistic and hybrid explanations on equal footing.

This prevents false dichotomies.

---

### 5.2 Permitted Models

Examples include:

- procedural or templated generation systems
- visual grammar models
- symbolic but non-linguistic encoding systems
- diagram-first systems with text-like artifacts

Models must be explicit and falsifiable.

---

### 5.3 Required Outputs

- Model assumptions
- Fit to Phase 1 structures
- Comparison against linguistic models
- Failure analysis

---

### 5.4 Stop Conditions

Stop when:

- model collapses into narrative
- model cannot be falsified
- model explains controls as well as real data

---

## 6. Cross-Track Requirements

All tracks must:

- consume Phase 1 outputs read-only
- reuse Phase 1 controls
- introduce new controls where necessary
- record uncertainty explicitly
- document negative results

No track may override another.
Conflicts are data.

---

## 7. Phase 2 Deliverables

Phase 2 is considered complete when:

- at least one explanation class is ruled out
- admissibility boundaries are explicit for remaining classes
- translation feasibility is either tightly constrained or structurally implausible
- ambiguity is localized rather than global

“Nothing definitive” is an acceptable outcome.

---

## 8. Governance and Review

- All Phase 2 work must reference this roadmap
- Deviations require explicit justification
- Foundation code remains immutable
- Analysis code must remain modular and removable

---

## 9. Relationship to Future Work

Phase 2 may enable:

- a separate translation-focused project
- publication of negative or constraining results
- formal arguments about non-linguistic structure

Phase 2 does not include these activities.

---

## 10. Final Statement

Phase 2 is about admissibility, not answers.

If Phase 2 feels slow, constrained, or unsatisfying, it is functioning correctly.

This roadmap exists to prevent the return of narrative-driven exploration.
