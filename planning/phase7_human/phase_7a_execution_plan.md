# PHASE_7_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Post-Structural Inquiry  
**Phase:** 7  
**Phase Name:** External Function and Production Constraints  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Evidence Type:** Non-textual, non-semantic, externally grounded  

---

## 1. Purpose of Phase 7

Phase 7 begins after the completion of Phases 5 and 6, which together:

- identified the Voynich Manuscript’s production phase5_mechanism,
- characterized its internal phase6_functional behavior,
- and established a hard boundary on what text-internal evidence can resolve.

The purpose of Phase 7 is **not to infer meaning**, but to test **external constraints** that may narrow the manuscript’s function, origin, or use.

Phase 7 explicitly accepts that:
- function is not encoded in the text distribution,
- further narrowing requires new evidence classes.

---

## 2. Phase 7 Core Question

Given a **large, deterministic, efficiency-indifferent, formally executed system**, what *external constraints* does the manuscript’s physical, phase7_human, and historical context impose on plausible functions?

---

## 3. Phase 7 Design Principles

### 3.1 Evidence class shift
Phase 7 introduces evidence sources deliberately excluded from Phases 1–6, including:

- phase7_human production constraints,
- material and codicological features,
- phase8_comparative artifact classes.

Text statistics alone are no longer sufficient.

---

### 3.2 No semantic assumptions
Phase 7 does not assume:
- language,
- symbolism,
- encoded meaning.

All tests are grounded in **measurable physical or behavioral proxies**.

---

### 3.3 Constraint-based narrowing
Phase 7 does not aim to identify *the* function.  
It aims to **eliminate incompatible phase6_functional categories**.

---

## 4. Phase 7 Structure

Phase 7 is composed of three semi-independent sub-phases:

- **Phase 7A:** Human Factors and Production Ergonomics  
- **Phase 7B:** Codicological and Material Coupling  
- **Phase 7C:** Comparative Formal Artifact Analysis  

Each sub-phase introduces a new evidentiary axis.

---

## 5. Phase 7A – Human Factors and Production Ergonomics

### Objective
Determine what the manuscript’s structure implies about the **producer’s workflow**, effort, and constraints.

### Core questions
- How costly was production in time and attention?
- Was production likely continuous or episodic?
- Does the execution imply training, ritual discipline, or mastery demonstration?

### Evidence and metrics
- Stroke complexity and repetition cost
- Error and correction distributions
- Line completion behavior
- Fatigue proxies (variance drift within pages or quires)

### Kill targets
Eliminate functions incompatible with:
- sustained high-effort execution,
- zero-error tolerance,
- prolonged attention demands.

---

## 6. Phase 7B – Codicological and Material Constraints

### Objective
Test whether the formal system interacts with the manuscript as a **physical object**.

### Core questions
- Was text generated in situ or copied?
- Does layout constrain generation?
- Are there production mode shifts across quires or hands?

### Evidence and metrics
- Page layout regularities
- Quire boundary effects
- Scribal hand transitions
- Ink and pen variation alignment

### Kill targets
Eliminate functions incompatible with:
- observed production sequencing,
- material continuity or discontinuity,
- physical affordances of the codex.

---

## 7. Phase 7C – Comparative Formal Artifact Analysis

### Objective
Situate the Voynich Manuscript within a broader class of **formal, rule-based artifacts**.

### Core questions
- Do known artifacts instantiate similar mechanisms?
- Is this type of system historically attested?
- Does the manuscript resemble training tools, ritual systems, or combinatorial devices?

### Evidence and metrics
- Mechanism fingerprint matching
- Structural similarity (not symbol similarity)
- Functional role of comparable artifacts

### Kill targets
Eliminate categories requiring:
- semantic transmission,
- efficient reuse,
- communicative redundancy.

---

## 8. Integration and Synthesis

Phase 7 results are integrated through **constraint intersection**, not narrative phase3_synthesis.

Outcomes include:
- narrowing to one or two viable phase6_functional categories,
- or demonstrating persistent underdetermination even with external evidence.

Both outcomes are valid.

---

## 9. Termination Conditions

Phase 7 terminates when:
- all three sub-phases are executed,
- incompatible phase6_functional categories are eliminated,
- remaining uncertainty is explicitly documented.

Phase 7 does **not** require a positive identification.

---

## 10. Relationship to Prior Phases

- Phases 1–5: Mechanism identification (text-internal)
- Phase 6: Functional characterization (text-internal)
- Phase 7: Constraint-based narrowing (external evidence)

Phase 7 is not a continuation of Phase 6 logic.  
It is a **new evidentiary lane**, justified by Phase 6 closure.

---

## 11. Final Statement

Phase 7 acknowledges a core result of the project:

> The Voynich Manuscript’s text is a complete description of its phase5_mechanism, but an incomplete description of its function.

Phase 7 asks what the *world around the manuscript* can tell us that the text itself cannot.
