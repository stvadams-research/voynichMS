# PHASE_7_PRINCIPLES_AND_NON_GOALS.md

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript – Post-Structural Inquiry  
**Phase:** 7  
**Phase Name:** External Constraints and Functional Narrowing  
**Status:** ACTIVE (Scaffolding Document)  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **principles, non-goals, and high-level approach** for Phase 7 of the Voynich project.

Phase 7 begins after the formal closure of all text-internal questions (Phases 1–6).  
It exists to ensure that any continued work:

- remains epistemically rigorous,
- does not regress into speculative interpretation,
- and clearly distinguishes **what can be tested** from **what cannot**.

This file is intentionally high-level.  
Detailed execution plans for Phase 7A, 7B, and 7C are defined separately.

---

## 2. Why Phase 7 Exists

Phases 1–6 established the following boundary:

- The Voynich Manuscript’s **mechanism is fully characterized**.
- Its **function is not encoded in text-internal structure**.
- Further narrowing cannot be achieved through statistical, grammatical, or structural analysis of the text alone.

Phase 7 exists because **continuing to ask text-only questions would violate the project’s own standards**.

Phase 7 explicitly changes the evidentiary basis of inquiry.

---

## 3. Core Epistemic Shift

### Phase 6 Question
What does the text itself prove about its structure and function?

### Phase 7 Question
Given the structure we have proven, **what external constraints must any viable function satisfy?**

Phase 7 does not attempt to “solve” the manuscript.  
It attempts to **rule out incompatible categories of use, production, and purpose**.

---

## 4. Governing Principles of Phase 7

### 4.1 Constraint-Based, Not Interpretive
Phase 7 proceeds by identifying **constraints**, not narratives.

- We eliminate possibilities that violate constraints.
- We do not privilege stories that merely sound plausible.

---

### 4.2 Evidence Class Expansion
Phase 7 introduces evidence types deliberately excluded from earlier phases, including:

- human production ergonomics,
- physical and codicological properties,
- comparative formal artifacts.

Text statistics alone are insufficient.

---

### 4.3 No Semantic Assumptions
Phase 7 does not assume:

- linguistic meaning,
- symbolic encoding,
- allegorical intent,
- hidden plaintext.

Any hypothesis requiring semantic decoding is out of scope unless independently supported by non-textual evidence.

---

### 4.4 Negative Results Are Valid
Failure to narrow further is a valid outcome.

Phase 7 is allowed to conclude:
- that multiple functional categories remain compatible, or
- that function is fundamentally underdetermined even with external evidence.

---

### 4.5 No Retroactive Revision
Results from Phases 1–6 are treated as **frozen and authoritative**.

Phase 7 does not:
- reopen mechanism identification,
- reinterpret Phase 6 outcomes,
- or reintroduce eliminated hypothesis classes.

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals of Phase 7

Phase 7 will NOT:

- attempt translation or partial translation,
- assign symbolic meaning to glyphs or diagrams,
- infer author identity, culture, or psychology,
- claim ritual, religious, or mystical intent without constraints,
- reclassify the manuscript as language or cipher,
- produce speculative historical narratives.

If a question cannot be answered without interpretation, it is out of scope.

---

## 6. What Phase 7 *Can* Legitimately Narrow

Phase 7 may narrow:

- whether production required sustained high effort or casual execution,
- whether a physical aid (tables, grilles, diagrams) was required,
- whether the manuscript was generated incrementally or copied,
- whether production was solo or collaborative,
- whether the artifact resembles known classes of formal systems.

These are **structural and ergonomic questions**, not semantic ones.

---

## 7. High-Level Phase 7 Structure

Phase 7 is divided into three sub-phases, each addressing a different external constraint axis:

### Phase 7A – Human Factors and Production Ergonomics
Focus:
- effort, time, error tolerance, attention demands.

Goal:
- eliminate functions incompatible with observed production discipline.

---

### Phase 7B – Codicological and Material Constraints
Focus:
- physical layout, quires, scribal hands, ink, page geometry.

Goal:
- determine whether production was in situ, copied, staged, or modular.

---

### Phase 7C – Comparative Formal Artifact Analysis
Focus:
- comparison to known formal, combinatorial, or procedural artifacts.

Goal:
- situate the manuscript within or outside known artifact classes.

---

## 8. Relationship Between Phase 7 Sub-Phases

- Phase 7A, 7B, and 7C are **execution-independent**.
- Results are **interpretively coupled** during synthesis.
- No sub-phase may alter the execution plan of another.

Integration occurs only after all three are complete.

---

## 9. Criteria for Phase 7 Success

Phase 7 is successful if it produces:

- a clearly narrowed set of viable functional categories, or
- a formal demonstration that function remains underdetermined even with external evidence.

Both outcomes are acceptable and scientifically meaningful.

---

## 10. Phase 7 Termination Boundary

Phase 7 terminates when:

- all planned external constraint tests are executed,
- remaining uncertainty is explicitly documented,
- and no further narrowing is possible without introducing untestable assumptions.

At that point, continued inquiry would constitute a **new project**, not an extension of this one.

---

## 11. Final Framing Statement

Phase 7 is not about answering “What is the Voynich Manuscript?”

It is about answering a harder and more disciplined question:

> Given everything we can prove, what **cannot** be true, and what **must remain open**?

This phase preserves the project’s core commitment:
to stop exactly where the evidence stops, and not one step beyond.
