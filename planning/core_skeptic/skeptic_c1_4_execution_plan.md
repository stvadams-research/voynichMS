# Execution Plan: Skeptic Critical Sensitivity Release-Contract Closure (SK-C1.4)

**Source Assessment (requested):** `reports/core_skeptic/ADVERSARIAL_SKEPTIC_ASSESSMENT_2026-02-10_4.md`  
**Source Assessment (available):** `reports/skepitic/ADVERSARIAL_SKEPTIC_ASSESSMENT_2026-02-10_4.md`  
**Finding Target:** `SK-C1` (Critical, pass-4 residual)  
**Plan Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Execution Policy:** Plan-only in this revision. Do not execute changes from this document yet.

---

## 1) Objective

Close the recurring SK-C1 release blocker by establishing a single, reliable, and testable release sensitivity evidence path that:

1. always produces release artifacts at canonical paths,
2. passes release-mode contract checks in pre-release, verify, and CI flows,
3. exposes progress/state clearly enough to avoid repeated aborted or duplicated runs,
4. prevents regression to iterative/non-release artifacts being used as release evidence.

This is the fourth attempt; completeness and anti-regression are first-class requirements.

---

## 2) SK-C1 Problem Statement (Pass 4)

From `reports/skepitic/ADVERSARIAL_SKEPTIC_ASSESSMENT_2026-02-10_4.md`:

- `pre_release_check.sh` fails immediately on missing release artifact.
- `verify_reproduction.sh` fails on the same missing release artifact.
- `ci_check.sh` fails at release-candidate sensitivity contract stage for the same reason.

Current blocker is specific and singular:

- `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep_release.json` is missing.

Relevant enforcement points:

- `scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh:13`
- `scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh:18`
- `scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh:21`
- `scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py:248`
- `scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py:252`
- `scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py:255`
- `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh:120`
- `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh:122`
- `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh:141`
- `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh:144`
- `scripts/ci_check.sh:123`
- `scripts/ci_check.sh:127`

Gate impact remains explicit:

- `core_status/core_audit/release_gate_health_status.json:10` -> `GATE_HEALTH_DEGRADED`
- `core_status/core_audit/release_gate_health_status.json:11` -> `GATE_CONTRACT_BLOCKED`
- `core_status/core_audit/release_gate_health_status.json:17` -> `SENSITIVITY_RELEASE_CONTRACT_BLOCKED`

Compounding context:

- CI sensitivity artifact exists but is iterative/non-release:
  - `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep.json:54` -> `dataset_id=voynich_synthetic_grammar`
  - `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep.json:70` -> `execution_mode=iterative`
  - `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep.json:81` -> `release_evidence_ready=false`

---

## 3) Root-Cause Hypothesis Stack

This plan assumes repeated SK-C1 failure is not only a one-off missing file issue, but a process-shape issue with four layers:

1. **Production-path fragility:** release artifact generation is optional/manual instead of guaranteed by a canonical pipeline step.
2. **Late failure timing:** gate scripts fail after entering release checks instead of using a deterministic preflight path with actionable state.
3. **Operational friction:** release sensitivity runs are expensive, making retries brittle without progress/checkpoint visibility.
4. **Contract coupling drift risk:** producer, checker, gate scripts, and gate-health reasons can drift unless parity is test-locked.

---

## 4) Scope and Non-Goals

## In Scope

- SK-C1 release sensitivity artifact/report generation and contract compliance.
- Release-mode contract parity across:
  - `scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh`
  - `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh`
  - `scripts/ci_check.sh`
  - `scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py`
  - `scripts/core_audit/build_release_gate_health_status.py`
- Sensitivity runner observability/testability improvements required to reliably complete release runs.
- Regression tests for missing-artifact and release-mode parity failure classes.

## Out of Scope

- SK-C2/H1/H2/H3/M1/M2/M3/M4 remediation except strict dependencies.
- Changing scientific conclusions of sensitivity phase2_analysis in this planning pass.
- Manual artifact patching without deterministic runner support.

---

## 5) Success Criteria (Exit Conditions)

SK-C1.4 is closed only when all conditions hold:

1. Canonical release artifacts exist and are generated by release-mode runner path:
   - `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_sweep_release.json`
   - `reports/core_audit/SENSITIVITY_RESULTS_RELEASE.md`
2. Release contract checker passes:
   - `python3 scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py --mode release`
3. All three gate paths pass SK-C1 stage with identical semantics:
   - `scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh`
   - `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh`
   - `scripts/ci_check.sh`
4. `release_gate_health_status.json` transitions out of sensitivity-blocked state and reflects consistent reason codes.
5. Release evidence generation is operationally reliable (progress visibility + restart-safe behavior + fast preflight).
6. New regression tests prevent recurrence of missing-release-artifact and mode-mismatch regressions.

## 6) Workstreams

## WS-C1.4-A: Baseline Freeze and Contract Register

**Goal:** Lock the pass-4 failure tuple and prevent ambiguity about what is broken.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Freeze pass-4 SK-C1 blocker evidence with line-linked references. | New `reports/core_skeptic/SK_C1_4_CONTRACT_REGISTER.md` | Register lists every failing check and reason path. |
| A2 | Map producer->artifact->checker->gate->gate-health dependency graph. | same + diagrams/section | Full chain is explicit and testable. |
| A3 | Define single canonical SK-C1 release artifact/report paths and override policy. | register + docs | No path ambiguity remains. |

### Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py --mode release
python3 scripts/core_audit/build_release_gate_health_status.py
```

---

## WS-C1.4-B: Release Artifact Generation Hardening

**Goal:** Make release artifact generation deterministic and atomic.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Ensure `run_sensitivity_sweep.py --mode release` always emits release JSON and release markdown to canonical paths. | `scripts/phase2_analysis/run_sensitivity_sweep.py` | Release run cannot complete without both artifacts written. |
| B2 | Add atomic write semantics (temp file + rename) for release artifacts. | same | No partially written release artifacts are observable. |
| B3 | Add explicit provenance keys for release path identity (mode, dataset, scenario profile). | release artifact schema | Consumers can verify provenance intent without phase4_inference. |

### Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/phase2_analysis/run_sensitivity_sweep.py --mode release --dataset-id voynich_real
python3 scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py --mode release
```

---

## WS-C1.4-C: Preflight and Fail-Fast Release Readiness

**Goal:** Fail quickly before expensive release runs when prerequisites are impossible.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Add a release preflight mode that validates dataset policy and contract prerequisites before heavy computation. | `scripts/phase2_analysis/run_sensitivity_sweep.py` | Preflight emits machine-readable pass/fail and reason codes. |
| C2 | Wire preflight checks into pre-release and verify scripts before full release sweep expectations. | `scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh`, `scripts/verify_reproduction.sh` | Scripts fail early with deterministic remediation message. |
| C3 | Emit `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_release_preflight.json` for gate-health and core_audit traceability. | new status artifact | Preflight state is visible and policy-checkable. |

### Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/phase2_analysis/run_sensitivity_sweep.py --mode release --preflight-only
bash scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh
bash scripts/verify_reproduction.sh
```

---

## WS-C1.4-D: Runtime Observability and Repeatability (Operational Reliability)

**Goal:** Make expensive sensitivity release runs observable and restart-safe.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Emit structured progress heartbeat during sweep execution (scenario index, stage, elapsed, ETA, warning counts). | `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_progress.json` | Operators can distinguish slow progress from stalled process. |
| D2 | Add scenario-level checkpointing to avoid full reruns on interruption. | `core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_checkpoint.json` (or equivalent) | Interrupted run can resume safely at next scenario. |
| D3 | Add explicit progress logging in console at bounded interval to reduce false lockup interpretation. | runner logs | Long runs show deterministic activity updates. |
| D4 | Keep smoke/iterative pathways contract-compatible for quick validation without masquerading as release evidence. | runner + checker policy | Fast tests validate logic without polluting release path. |

### Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/phase2_analysis/run_sensitivity_sweep.py --mode iterative --quick
cat core_status/core_audit/sensitivity_progress.json
```

---

## WS-C1.4-E: Release-Readiness Semantics and Checker Parity

**Goal:** Remove any producer/checker semantic mismatch on release readiness.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Define release-readiness as strict conjunction of required fields (`execution_mode`, `dataset_policy_pass`, `warning_policy_pass`, `quality_gate_passed`, `robustness_conclusive`, scenario counts, empty failures). | runner + checker policy | No contradictory release-ready states are possible. |
| E2 | Ensure `release_readiness_failures` reason set is complete and deterministic. | runner output schema | Every false release-ready condition has explicit reason code. |
| E3 | Ensure markdown report mirrors release JSON summary fields exactly under release mode. | report renderer + contract checker | Contract checker catches any drift immediately. |

### Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py --mode release
python3 scripts/core_audit/check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py --mode ci
```

---

## WS-C1.4-F: Gate Integration and Reason-Code Coherence

**Goal:** Ensure pre-release, verify, CI, and gate-health all agree on SK-C1 state.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Centralize SK-C1 release check invocation so all gate scripts call the same checker pathway. | gate scripts | Same input state yields same failure mode across all gates. |
| F2 | Ensure CI release-candidate stage either preflights first or exits with canonical missing-artifact reason set. | `scripts/ci_check.sh` | CI failure reason is precise and non-duplicative. |
| F3 | Align `build_release_gate_health_status.py` reason-code mapping with checker output (`SENSITIVITY_RELEASE_CONTRACT_BLOCKED` and sub-reasons). | `scripts/core_audit/build_release_gate_health_status.py` | Gate-health reason codes are stable and auditable. |

### Verification

```bash
bash scripts/ci_check.sh
bash scripts/core_audit/pre_release_check.sh
bash scripts/verify_reproduction.sh
python3 scripts/core_audit/build_release_gate_health_status.py
```

---

## WS-C1.4-G: Regression Tests and Contract Locking

**Goal:** Prevent a fifth attempt for the same SK-C1 class.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Add tests for missing release artifact behavior and exact remediation output. | `tests/core_audit/test_pre_release_contract.py`, `tests/core_audit/test_verify_reproduction_contract.py`, `tests/core_audit/test_ci_check_contract.py` | Missing-artifact regression is test-locked. |
| G2 | Add release-runner tests covering preflight, progress output schema, and release artifact emission. | `tests/phase2_analysis/test_sensitivity_sweep_end_to_end.py` (+ new focused tests) | Release path and operational visibility are covered. |
| G3 | Add gate-health builder tests for sensitivity blocker transitions and dependency snapshot fields. | `tests/core_audit/test_release_gate_health_status_builder.py` | Entitlement status cannot drift silently. |

### Verification

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q \
  tests/phase2_analysis/test_sensitivity_sweep_end_to_end.py \
  tests/core_audit/test_pre_release_contract.py \
  tests/core_audit/test_verify_reproduction_contract.py \
  tests/core_audit/test_ci_check_contract.py \
  tests/core_audit/test_release_gate_health_status_builder.py
```

## WS-C1.4-H: Governance Closeout and Traceability

**Goal:** Capture end-to-end evidence from failure to closure.

| ID | Task | Target Artifacts | Completion Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Create SK-C1.4 execution status report template and evidence checklist. | `reports/core_skeptic/SKEPTIC_C1_4_EXECUTION_STATUS.md` (during execution) | Implementation pass has a fixed reporting structure. |
| H2 | Update runbook/repro docs for release sensitivity run sequence and preflight expectations. | `governance/governance/REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, `governance/RUNBOOK.md`, `governance/SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS.md` | Docs match implemented gate behavior. |
| H3 | Add core_audit-log linkage for SK-C1.4 with reason codes, commands, and final gate state. | `AUDIT_LOG.md` | Full trace is auditable and reproducible. |

### Verification

```bash
rg -n "SK-C1.4|sensitivity_sweep_release|SENSITIVITY_RELEASE_CONTRACT_BLOCKED|release_evidence_ready" \
  docs reports AUDIT_LOG.md core_status/core_audit/release_gate_health_status.json
```

## 7) Execution Order

1. WS-C1.4-A (baseline register)
2. WS-C1.4-B (artifact generation hardening)
3. WS-C1.4-C (preflight and fail-fast)
4. WS-C1.4-D (runtime observability/repeatability)
5. WS-C1.4-E (release-readiness semantic parity)
6. WS-C1.4-F (gate integration and reason coherence)
7. WS-C1.4-G (tests/contracts)
8. WS-C1.4-H (governance closeout)

Rationale:

- Stabilize producer path first, then enforce consumer parity, then lock with tests and governance.

---

## 8) Decision Matrix for SK-C1.4

| Condition | Output Status | Allowed Claim |
|---|---|---|
| Release artifacts exist and all SK-C1 release checks pass coherently across pre-release/verify/CI/gate-health. | `C1_4_ALIGNED` | "Sensitivity release evidence is contract-consistent and release-valid." |
| Contract and gate semantics are coherent, but release evidence still fails by legitimate quality/data criteria. | `C1_4_QUALIFIED` | "SK-C1.4 integrity is restored; release evidence remains policy non-ready." |
| Any producer/checker/gate mismatch persists. | `C1_4_BLOCKED` | "SK-C1 remains blocked by release-contract inconsistency." |
| Evidence is incomplete to classify closure. | `C1_4_INCONCLUSIVE` | "SK-C1.4 status remains provisional." |

## 10) Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Release run remains too expensive to iterate, causing repeated incomplete attempts. | High | High | Add preflight + progress + checkpoint to make long runs operationally manageable. |
| R2 | Release artifact generated but semantically non-ready due dataset/warning constraints. | Medium | High | Keep strict release-readiness conjunction and explicit reason codes; avoid false pass. |
| R3 | Checker/gate reason-code drift causes inconsistent failure narratives. | Medium | Medium | Centralize checker usage and add reason-code parity tests. |
| R4 | CI path continues to fail late/nested, obscuring root cause. | Medium | Medium | Fail early with explicit missing-artifact/preflight reasons in CI stage. |
| R5 | Manual artifact copying/relabeling bypasses provenance intent and causes brittle state. | Medium | High | Require runner-emitted release artifacts with explicit provenance mode keys. |

---

## 11) Deliverables

Required deliverables for execution pass:

1. `reports/core_skeptic/SK_C1_4_CONTRACT_REGISTER.md`
2. Hardened release-path sensitivity runner behavior
3. Preflight artifact and fail-fast integration in pre-release/verify/CI
4. Progress/checkpoint observability for sensitivity runs
5. Updated SK-C1 release checker/gate-health reason coherence
6. Expanded SK-C1 regression tests across phase2_analysis/core_audit suites
7. `reports/core_skeptic/SKEPTIC_C1_4_EXECUTION_STATUS.md`
8. `AUDIT_LOG.md` trace for SK-C1.4 closure attempt

---

## 12) Closure Criteria

SK-C1 (pass-4 scope) can be marked closed only when:

1. Release artifact/report are produced at canonical paths by release-mode runner.
2. `check_sensitivity_artifact_contract.py --mode release` passes.
3. `pre_release_check.sh`, `verify_reproduction.sh`, and `ci_check.sh` all pass SK-C1 checks without semantic mismatch.
4. `release_gate_health_status.json` no longer reports `SENSITIVITY_RELEASE_CONTRACT_BLOCKED`.
5. Tests explicitly cover the pass-4 failure class (missing release artifact + release-path parity).

Until then, SK-C1 remains **OPEN**.
