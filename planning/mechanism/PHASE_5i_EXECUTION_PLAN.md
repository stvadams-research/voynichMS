# Phase 5I Execution Plan (Revised): Mechanism Integrity and External Anchoring

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript, Structural Admissibility Program  
**Phase:** 5I (Revised)  
**Phase Name:** Mechanism Integrity and External Coupling  
**Goal Type:** Validation and scoping of mechanism uniformity under non-textual structure  
**Primary Goal:** Determine whether the already-identified deterministic production mechanism is **globally uniform** across the manuscript or **modulated** by physical manuscript features (sections, layout, illustrations), **without collapsing remaining internal ambiguities** (e.g., DAG vs implicit lattice).

---

## 0. Why This Revision Exists

### 0.1 What changed
The original Phase 5I plan implicitly treated the *Implicit Constraint Lattice* as settled. Subsequent analysis showed that while this topology is a leading candidate, it is **not yet uniquely identified**. Two internal classes remain admissible:

- High-connectivity explicit graph (DAG-like)
- Implicit constraint lattice (feature-conditioned rules)

This revised Phase 5I corrects that framing error.

### 0.2 What this revision does
- Re-scopes Phase 5I to test **mechanism integrity and coupling**, not internal dependency scope.
- Explicitly defers DAG vs lattice discrimination to a later phase (dependency-scope analysis).
- Preserves all previously executed Phase 5I-style analyses as valid, but **reinterprets their conclusions conservatively**.

No data is discarded. Only the claims are tightened.

## 1. Phase 5I Purpose and Core Question

### 1.1 Core question
Is the deterministic production mechanism **single and globally stable**, or does it vary in structure or parameters as a function of physical manuscript features such as sections, layout, or illustration proximity?

### 1.2 What Phase 5I tests
- Global versus sectional mechanism stability
- Presence or absence of hybrid or multi-algorithm production
- Whether non-textual features bias or reseed traversal behavior

### 1.3 What Phase 5I explicitly does NOT test
- Where constraints live internally (local edges vs global features)
- Whether the topology is a DAG or an implicit lattice
- Any semantic, symbolic, or interpretive meaning

Those questions are deferred.

---

## 2. Phase 5I Success Criteria

Phase 5I is successful if it produces:

- Evidence that the manuscript is generated by **one global deterministic rule-system**
- Quantification of how invariant key mechanism signatures are across sections
- A clear determination of whether physical manuscript features:
  - change the mechanism,
  - modulate traversal parameters, or
  - have no detectable effect

Failure to find coupling is a valid and informative outcome.

## 3. Design Principles

### 3.1 Integrity before refinement
Before refining internal structure, we must establish that there is only **one** structure.

### 3.2 Anchoring without interpretation
Illustrations and layout are treated as **geometric or positional anchors only**, never as carriers of meaning.

### 3.3 Conservative inference
Any result compatible with multiple internal models must be reported as such.

---

## 4. Signature Test Families

### 4.1 Sectional Stability Test (Global Machine Audit)
**Objective:**  
Test whether core mechanism signatures remain stable across codicological sections.

**Metrics:**
- Effective rank (latent dimensionality)
- Successor consistency (path forcing)
- Reset behavior at line boundaries

**Kill rule:**  
If any section exhibits a statistically distinct regime (e.g., different rank scale or successor forcing collapse), the single-mechanism hypothesis is falsified.

---

### 4.2 Cross-Section Structure Sharing
**Objective:**  
Determine whether different sections traverse the **same underlying structure**.

**Metrics:**
- Shared n-gram or path-fragment counts
- Overlap significance relative to matched non-semantic controls

**Interpretation rule:**  
Shared fragments support a common structure but do not imply identical traversal parameters.

---

### 4.3 Proximity-Conditioned Consistency (Exploratory)
**Objective:**  
Test whether proximity to illustrations or layout features modulates traversal determinism.

**Metrics:**
- Successor consistency near anchors versus block text
- Local reset or diversification signatures

**Status:**  
Exploratory only unless adequately powered.

**Non-claim:**  
Absence or presence of coupling does not identify internal constraint scope.

---

## 5. Execution Order

1) **Sectional Profiling**
   - Apply Phase 5B and 5E metrics independently to major sections.
2) **Structure Sharing Analysis**
   - Measure cross-section fragment reuse and overlap significance.
3) **Anchor Proximity Analysis**
   - Test for modulation of successor forcing near physical anchors.
4) **Synthesis**
   - Classify results as:
     - Global uniform
     - Globally uniform with parameter modulation
     - Hybrid (if falsified)

---

## 6. Allowed Conclusions

Phase 5I may conclude:

- Whether the manuscript is generated by a single global mechanism
- Whether sections differ by traversal rather than by rules
- Whether physical structure measurably couples to traversal behavior

Phase 5I may NOT conclude:

- That the mechanism is definitively an implicit lattice
- That the mechanism is definitively a DAG
- That illustrations encode meaning or keys

---

## 7. Deferred Questions (Explicit)

The following are explicitly deferred beyond Phase 5I:

- Constraint locality versus global feature dependence
- DAG versus lattice discrimination
- Any semantic or historical interpretation

These are addressed in the **dependency-scope phase** that follows.

---

## 8. Phase 5I Termination Statement (Revised)

Phase 5I evaluates the integrity and uniformity of the Voynich Manuscript’s deterministic production mechanism under physical manuscript structure. By testing for sectional divergence and external coupling, Phase 5I establishes whether the manuscript is the output of a single global rule-system or a composite of multiple mechanisms. Internal dependency scope and topology discrimination are explicitly deferred.

## 9. Immediate Next Actions

1) Re-run Phase 5I analyses with revised claim boundaries
2) Update Phase 5I results language to reflect conservative conclusions
3) Freeze Phase 5I as a completed integrity audit
4) Proceed to the dependency-scope phase (formerly planned as Phase 5H)
