# Phase 5 Execution Plan: Identifiability of Production Mechanisms

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript, Structural Admissibility Program  
**Phase:** 5  
**Phase Name:** Identifiability  
**Goal Type:** Hypothesis class narrowing via necessary-condition testing  
**Primary Goal:** Systematically reduce the space of admissible production mechanisms for the Voynich Manuscript by testing class-specific necessary signatures, without assuming semantics.

---

## 1. Phase 5 Purpose and Core Question

### 1.1 Core question
Given that semantics is not established and structure alone is insufficient, which classes of production mechanisms are identifiable, distinguishable, or eliminable using the observed properties of the Voynich Manuscript?

### 1.2 Why Phase 5 exists
Phases 1 through 4.5 established that:
- The manuscript has strong internal structure.
- Structure alone does not imply meaning.
- Existing statistical methods are not diagnostic of semantics.
- Remaining explanations form a constrained but nontrivial hypothesis space.

Phase 5 advances the program by:
- Treating explanations as competing mechanism classes.
- Asking which classes are observationally distinguishable.
- Eliminating classes that violate necessary consequences.

### 1.3 What Phase 5 is not
- Not a translation effort.
- Not an attempt to prove semantics.
- Not a historical reconstruction.
- Not a plausibility ranking based on intuition or aesthetics.

Phase 5 evaluates identifiability, not truth.

### 1.4 Success criteria
Phase 5 is successful if it produces:
- A finite, explicit list of admissible mechanism classes.
- A set of eliminated classes with documented violations.
- A reduced set of observationally equivalent classes that cannot be separated by text-internal evidence alone.
- Clear documentation of what additional evidence would be required to separate remaining classes.

## 2. Phase 5 Design Principles

### 2.1 Class-first reasoning
All analysis proceeds from predefined mechanism classes, not individual hypotheses.

No mechanism is evaluated unless it is explicitly defined as a class with shared properties.

### 2.2 Necessary-condition testing only
Phase 5 tests only necessary consequences of each class.

A class is eliminated if any necessary condition is violated.  
A class is not confirmed if conditions are satisfied.

### 2.3 Structural matching constraint
All tests must control for Phase 1 to Phase 3 structural properties.

Comparators used for evidence must be matched on:
- Token frequency distribution
- Repetition and locality
- Entropy profiles
- Section-level variation

This prevents rediscovering known structure.

### 2.4 Adversarial symmetry
Semantic and non-semantic classes are treated symmetrically.

No class is privileged by default.

### 2.5 Pre-registration and no post hoc rule changes
Before running any Phase 5 evaluation:
- Each class must have written necessary consequences
- Each consequence must have an observable proxy
- Each proxy must have a kill rule

No post hoc redefinitions.

---

## 3. Hypothesis Class Set

Phase 5 begins by freezing a finite set of mechanism classes.

### 3.1 Core mechanism classes (minimum set)

1) **Bounded Pool Reuse**
   - Tokens drawn from limited pools with locality constraints.
   - No latent state beyond pool membership and selection heuristics.

2) **Table or Grille Selection**
   - Tokens generated by traversing structured tables or grids.
   - Hidden row or column states determine output.

3) **Copying with Systematic Mutation**
   - New text produced by copying prior text and applying constrained edits.
   - Local genealogies exist between passages.

4) **Multi-Stage Pipeline**
   - Output of one process is transformed by another process.
   - Example: table output followed by smoothing or normalization.

5) **Low-Entropy Codebook Mapping**
   - Tokens map to a small set of latent categories.
   - Not full natural language, but not purely mechanical reuse.

6) **Compressed or Abbreviated Natural Language**
   - Natural language under extreme abbreviation and orthographic distortion.
   - Semantics present but heavily masked.

### 3.2 Class documentation requirement
For each class, document:
- Defining assumptions
- Degrees of freedom
- Allowed transforms
- What counts as an instance of the class
- What is explicitly excluded

Deliverable:
- `reports/PHASE_5_HYPOTHESIS_CLASSES.md`

---

## 4. Necessary Consequences Framework

### 4.1 Definition
A necessary consequence is a property that must appear in any realization of a class, regardless of parameter choice.

If the property is absent, the class is eliminated.

### 4.2 Consequence specification template (required)
For each class, define 3 to 5 consequences using this template:

- **Consequence ID:** C5.<class>.<n>  
- **Statement:** what must be true  
- **Observable proxy:** what we measure  
- **Null model:** what a non-instance looks like  
- **Kill rule:** explicit elimination threshold or criterion  
- **Robustness:** which perturbations must not flip the decision  
- **Artifacts:** plots and tables to write per run

Deliverable:
- `reports/PHASE_5_NECESSARY_CONSEQUENCES.md`

---

## 5. Signature Tests (Mechanism-Targeted, Not Semantic-Proxies)

Phase 5 implements tests designed to detect necessary consequences, not meaning.

Below are recommended test families. Each should be written as a module with fixed inputs and recorded artifacts.

### 5.1 Copying-with-mutation signatures
Candidate tests:
- **Variant family detection:** clusters of near-duplicate lines or n-grams with constrained edits
- **Edit-graph structure:** ancestry-like graphs with high local clustering and directionality
- **Locality constraint:** variant families appear within bounded windows more than expected under matched non-copying generators

Representative kill rules:
- No excess of constrained-edit families beyond matched non-copying controls
- No detectable directionality or genealogy under robust thresholds

### 5.2 Table or grille signatures
Candidate tests:
- **Hidden-state recoverability:** infer low-cardinality latent states that predict successor sets
- **Successor set sharpness:** abrupt constraints on what can follow what, stable across the corpus
- **State transition sparsity:** low-entropy transition patterns consistent with table traversal

Representative kill rules:
- No stable latent-state model improves prediction versus matched non-table generators
- Successor constraints dissolve under mild perturbations inconsistent with table mechanisms

### 5.3 Bounded pool reuse signatures
Candidate tests:
- **Pool exhaustion dynamics:** measurable novelty rates that require pool replenishment schedules
- **Reuse saturation curves:** how often reused tokens recur as length increases
- **Windowed TTR behavior:** vocabulary growth shape within locality windows

Representative kill rules:
- Observed novelty and TTR growth incompatible with any bounded-pool schedule within allowed degrees of freedom
- Saturation behavior inconsistent with pool-only selection under matching constraints

### 5.4 Multi-stage pipeline signatures
Candidate tests:
- **Residual fingerprinting:** after fitting the best single-stage model, remaining structure is non-random and class-specific
- **Regime change detection:** transitions consistent with switching stages or applying a second transform family
- **Two-layer identifiability:** decomposability into two simpler mechanisms that separately fail

Representative kill rules:
- Best single-stage model explains all measurable structure at the signature level
- No evidence of stage-specific regime changes beyond sectioning artifacts

### 5.5 Codebook or compressed language signatures (gated, high bar)
Candidate tests:
- **Latent category stability:** inferred categories persist across partitions and perturbations
- **Out-of-sample predictability:** categories predict held-out continuations better than matched non-semantic generators
- **Adversarial matching:** non-semantic generators matched on Phase 1 to Phase 3 cannot replicate the predictive lift

Representative kill rules:
- Any predictive advantage disappears under strict multiple-comparisons control
- Matched non-semantic generators replicate the same predictive lift

Note: Passing these tests does not prove semantics, it only preserves codebook-like classes as admissible.

---

## 6. Comparator Suite and Matching Requirements

### 6.1 Matched generator suite
For each mechanism class, construct generators that:
- Match Voynich on Phase 1 to Phase 3 structural summaries
- Differ only in the class-defining mechanism

This forces Phase 5 tests to target signatures, not generic structure.

### 6.2 Adversarial hybrid generators
Include hybrids explicitly designed to spoof signatures, within the allowed degrees of freedom.

Purpose:
- validate that signatures are class-specific
- prevent trivial overfitting of tests to friendly baselines

Deliverable:
- `docs/GENERATOR_MATCHING.md`

---

## 7. Run Structure, Provenance, and Reproducibility

Phase 5 must run as a benchmark suite with deterministic provenance.

### 7.1 Canonical run manifest (required fields)
Each run must record:
- RunID
- corpus set and hashes
- hypothesis class and consequence ID
- test module name and version
- configuration and thresholds
- code version (commit hash)
- artifact list
- outcome label and kill rule evaluation

### 7.2 Standard folder structure (consistent with prior naming)
Recommended placement, using labeled domains:

- `src/mechanism/`  
  - `src/mechanism/classes/` (class definitions, parameter schemas)  
  - `src/mechanism/tests/` (signature tests, consequence evaluators)  
  - `src/mechanism/generators/` (Phase 5 matched generators, hybrids)  
  - `src/mechanism/matching/` (matching utilities and validators)

- `analysis/mechanism/`  
  - aggregation notebooks or scripts for result collation

- `configs/mechanism/`  
  - configs for each consequence test and generator match setup

- `results/mechanism/`  
  - aggregated tables and plots derived from immutable runs

- `runs/mechanism/<run_id>/`  
  - immutable run artifacts, manifests, outputs

- `reports/`  
  - narrative docs tied to RunIDs

This avoids `/phase5` naming while keeping Phase identity in report filenames.

### 7.3 Pre-run requirements
No Phase 5 runs begin until:
- determinism tests pass
- schema validation passes for run manifests
- generator matching validation passes for each comparator family
- necessary consequences are pre-registered

---

## 8. Evaluation and Outcome Labels

### 8.1 Outcome classes (exactly one per mechanism class)
- **Eliminated:** violates at least one necessary consequence
- **Admissible:** satisfies all tested necessary consequences
- **Observationally equivalent:** indistinguishable from one or more other classes under all implemented signature tests
- **Underdetermined:** key consequences could not be tested with available data

### 8.2 No plausibility ranking
Phase 5 does not rank classes by likelihood or historical appeal.

Only elimination, equivalence, and underdetermination are reported.

### 8.3 Equivalence reporting requirement
If two or more classes remain observationally equivalent, Phase 5 must explicitly document:
- what evidence would separate them
- whether that evidence is text-internal or external (codicology, scribal hands, illustration mapping)

Deliverable:
- `reports/PHASE_5_EQUIVALENCE_CLASSES.md`

---

## 9. Primary Outputs

### 9.1 Required reports
- `reports/PHASE_5_HYPOTHESIS_CLASSES.md`
- `reports/PHASE_5_NECESSARY_CONSEQUENCES.md`
- `reports/PHASE_5_METHOD_MAP.md` (tests and modules, consequence coverage)
- `reports/PHASE_5_RESULTS.md`
- `reports/PHASE_5_EQUIVALENCE_CLASSES.md`
- `reports/PHASE_5_CONCLUSIONS.md`

### 9.2 Required tables
- Class x consequence matrix (pass, fail, not-tested)
- Eliminations with linked evidence artifacts and RunIDs
- Remaining equivalence classes with separation requirements

### 9.3 Required artifacts per test run
At minimum:
- summary table of metrics used for the kill rule
- robustness table showing decision stability under perturbations
- at least one diagnostic plot per run tied to the consequence proxy

---

## 10. Interpretation Boundary

Phase 5 is allowed to conclude:
- Which mechanism classes are incompatible with the data
- Which classes are observationally equivalent under text-internal evidence
- What additional evidence would be required to separate survivors

Phase 5 is not allowed to conclude:
- That any surviving class is correct
- That semantics is present or absent
- That any historical narrative is true

---

## 11. Phase 5 Termination Statement

Phase 5 evaluates the identifiability of competing production mechanism classes for the Voynich Manuscript by testing necessary structural consequences under controlled conditions. By eliminating incompatible classes and identifying observational equivalence among survivors, Phase 5 narrows the space of admissible explanations without assuming semantics. Further progress requires either new forms of evidence or a change in the inferential target.

## 12. Immediate Next Actions

1) Freeze hypothesis class definitions  
   - Write `PHASE_5_HYPOTHESIS_CLASSES.md`

2) Pre-register necessary consequences and kill rules  
   - Write `PHASE_5_NECESSARY_CONSEQUENCES.md`

3) Build the matched comparator suite with validation  
   - Write `docs/GENERATOR_MATCHING.md`

4) Implement the first two signature test modules (recommended starting pair)
   - Copying with mutation: variant-family detection and edit-graph structure
   - Table or grille: latent-state recoverability and successor set sharpness

5) Run a small pilot benchmark
   - Voynich + 2 matched generators per class
   - Confirm determinism and artifact completeness
   - Only then scale to full suite
