# Phase 5C Execution Plan: Line-Conditioned Workflow Reconstruction

**Project:** Voynich Manuscript, Structural Admissibility Program  
**Phase:** 5C  
**Phase Name:** Workflow Identifiability  
**Goal Type:** Procedural phase5_mechanism reconstruction under boundary-coupled constraints  
**Primary Goal:** Identify and characterize the minimal line-conditioned production workflow capable of reproducing the observed constraint geometry, reset behavior, and dimensionality of the Voynich Manuscript, without assuming semantics.

---

## 1. Phase 5C Purpose and Core Question

### 1.1 Core question
What minimal production workflow, operating at the line level with ephemeral latent state, is sufficient to generate the observed Voynich structure, including high within-line constraint, near-total line resets, and stable global statistics?

### 1.2 Why Phase 5C exists
Phase 5B established that:
- Constraints are strong within lines but do not persist across lines.
- Static tables and continuous traversals are eliminated.
- Effective dimensionality is moderate but repeatedly re-instantiated.
- The manuscript behaves as a highly non-persistent stochastic system.

These findings force a shift from abstract phase5_mechanism classes to **workflow reconstruction**.

### 1.3 What Phase 5C is not
- Not an interpretation of meaning.
- Not a historical narrative.
- Not a translation attempt.
- Not a search for latent semantics.

Phase 5C reconstructs *how* text is generated, not *what it means*.

### 1.4 Success criteria
Phase 5C is successful if it produces:
- A minimal, explicit workflow model that reproduces Phase 1–5B constraints.
- Bounds on line-level parameter distributions.
- Identification of redundant versus essential workflow components.
- A reduced set of admissible workflow families, or a proof of equivalence among them.

## 2. Phase 5C Design Principles

### 2.1 Line as atomic unit
The line is treated as the fundamental generation unit.
No model may carry latent state across line boundaries unless explicitly tested and justified.

### 2.2 Ephemeral latent state
Latent variables may exist within a line, but must reset or resample at each boundary unless evidence shows otherwise.

### 2.3 Parameter phase4_inference over rule phase4_inference
Phase 5C infers *distributions of parameters* governing line generators, not fixed grammars or token-level rules.

### 2.4 Minimal sufficiency
All proposed workflow components must be justified by necessity.
Components that can be removed without degrading fit are eliminated.

---

## 3. Workflow Model Abstraction

Phase 5C formalizes workflows as **line-conditioned generators**.

### 3.1 Canonical workflow structure
Each line is generated by:
1) Sampling a line-level parameter vector  
2) Generating a token sequence under those parameters  
3) Resetting all latent state at line end  

### 3.2 Candidate line-level parameters (non-exhaustive)
- Active pool size
- Pool composition (token inclusion probabilities)
- Successor sharpness or entropy budget
- Allowed affix or mutation operators
- Line length distribution
- Positional constraint flags (initial, medial, terminal)

These parameters are treated as random variables drawn from higher-level distributions.

---

## 4. Phase 5C Hypothesis Space

### 4.1 Core workflow families to evaluate

Minimum set:

1) **Independent Line-Scoped Pool**
   - Each line samples an independent token pool.
   - No overlap constraints beyond global frequency matching.

2) **Weakly Coupled Line Pools**
   - Line pools sampled from a slowly drifting global reservoir.
   - Overlap exists but no persistent state.

3) **Parameter-Coupled Lines**
   - Line generators share parameter distributions but not specific token pools.
   - Explains global regularities without state persistence.

4) **Two-Stage Line Workflow**
   - Initial stochastic generation followed by line-local normalization or filtering.

Each family must be instantiated with minimal degrees of freedom.

## 5. Necessary Consequences at the Workflow Level

Phase 5C defines **workflow-level necessary consequences**, distinct from Phase 5 phase5_mechanism consequences.

### 5.1 Examples of necessary consequences
- Line-level independence detectable via transition discontinuities.
- Parameter distributions that are stable globally but independent per line.
- Absence of cross-line predictive lift beyond chance.
- Consistent reproduction of Phase 5B reset scores.

### 5.2 Elimination logic
A workflow family is eliminated if:
- It requires persistent state to match observed constraints.
- It fails to reproduce dimensionality and entropy jointly.
- It introduces artifacts not present in the real manuscript.

Deliverable:
- `reports/PHASE_5C_NECESSARY_CONSEQUENCES.md`

## 6. Signature Tests and Analyses

Phase 5C introduces workflow-specific tests.

### 6.1 Line-level parameter phase4_inference
**Objective:**  
Infer distributions of line-level parameters from real data.

**Methods may include:**
- Fitting per-line entropy, pool size, and successor sharpness
- Clustering lines by inferred parameter vectors
- Comparing inferred distributions to generator outputs

**Kill criteria:**
- Inferred parameters require cross-line memory to be coherent.

---

### 6.2 Inter-line independence testing
**Objective:**  
Test whether adjacent lines share predictive structure beyond global statistics.

**Tests may include:**
- Cross-line mutual information
- Predictive lift of line N parameters on line N+1
- Permutation tests over line order

**Kill criteria:**
- Significant cross-line dependence incompatible with reset model.

---

### 6.3 Higher-order structure coupling
**Objective:**  
Determine whether line parameters cluster by:
- page
- section
- scribal hand
- layout features

This tests whether the workflow is purely local or hierarchically organized.

**Kill criteria:**
- Required hierarchy exceeds what Phase 5B allows.

---

### 6.4 Minimal simulator validation
**Objective:**  
Construct a minimal simulator implementing each workflow family and test sufficiency.

**Validation targets:**
- Phase 1 structural metrics
- Phase 3 repetition and locality
- Phase 5 variant and successor signatures
- Phase 5B dimensionality and reset scores

**Kill criteria:**
- Simulator requires additional ad hoc rules to match data.

---

## 7. Generator and Comparator Suite

### 7.1 Workflow simulators
For each workflow family, implement:
- A minimal simulator
- One adversarial variant designed to spoof results
- Parameter sweeps to identify necessary ranges

### 7.2 Comparator enforcement
All simulators must be matched to Voynich on:
- token inventory
- global frequency profile
- line length distribution

Deliverables:
- `src/phase5_mechanism/workflow/`
- `governance/WORKFLOW_SIMULATOR_SPEC.md`

---

## 8. Run Structure and Provenance

### 8.1 Canonical run manifest additions
Each Phase 5C run must record:
- workflow family ID
- parameter distributions used
- inferred versus simulated parameter comparison
- sufficiency outcome

### 8.2 Folder structure (consistent with prior phases)

- `src/phase5_mechanism/workflow/`
- `phase2_analysis/phase5_mechanism/workflow/`
- `configs/phase5_mechanism/workflow/`
- `runs/phase5_mechanism/<run_id>/`
- `results/phase5_mechanism/workflow/`
- `reports/`

---

## 9. Evaluation and Outcome Labels

### 9.1 Workflow outcome categories
Each workflow family receives exactly one label:
- **Eliminated:** incompatible with observed line-conditioned structure
- **Sufficient:** reproduces all tested signatures without extra assumptions
- **Equivalent:** indistinguishable from another family under current evidence
- **Underdetermined:** key properties cannot be tested with available data

### 9.2 Equivalence handling
If multiple workflows remain equivalent:
- Document required evidence to separate them.
- Classify evidence as text-internal or external.

Deliverable:
- `reports/PHASE_5C_EQUIVALENCE.md`

## 10. Interpretation Boundary

Phase 5C is allowed to conclude:
- What class of line-conditioned workflows is sufficient.
- What degrees of freedom are necessary versus optional.
- Whether workflow identifiability is achievable with text alone.

Phase 5C is not allowed to conclude:
- That any workflow encodes meaning.
- That the workflow reflects historical intent.
- That semantics is present or absent.

---

## 11. Phase 5C Termination Statement

Phase 5C reconstructs the minimal line-conditioned production workflow compatible with the Voynich Manuscript’s constraint geometry and reset behavior. By identifying sufficient and eliminating incompatible workflows, Phase 5C further collapses the space of admissible explanations without invoking semantics. Progress beyond this phase requires either external anchoring evidence or a change in inferential scope.

## 12. Immediate Next Actions

1) Finalize workflow family definitions  
2) Pre-register workflow-level necessary consequences  
3) Implement minimal simulators for each family  
4) Run line-parameter phase4_inference on the real manuscript  
5) Execute sufficiency benchmarks against matched simulators  
6) Decide whether workflow space collapses or remains equivalent
