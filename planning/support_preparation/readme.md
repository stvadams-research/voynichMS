# Publication Drafting Framework

This directory contains the scaffolding for generating a "Gold Standard" research publication. It is designed to pull raw data and visualizations into a structured, headline-first narrative.

## Workflow

1.  **Edit Chapters**: Modify the individual `index.md` files in the `chapters/` subdirectories. Each chapter follows the Inverted Pyramid structure:
    *   **Headline**: Bold claim.
    *   **Layman's Summary**: Simple explanation.
    *   **Technical Deep-Dive**: Data, math, and evidence.
    *   **Skeptic's Corner**: Counter-arguments.

2.  **Assemble Draft**: Run the assembly script to combine all chapters and data into a single master document.
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/support_preparation/assemble_draft.py
    ```

3.  **Review Master**: The output will be generated at `planning/support_preparation/DRAFT_MASTER.md`.

4.  **Export to Word**: Once the Markdown draft is ready, use **Pandoc** to convert it to a Microsoft Word document for final formatting:
    ```bash
    pandoc planning/support_preparation/DRAFT_MASTER.md -o Voynich_Research_Draft.docx
    ```

## Directory Structure

*   `chapters/`: Contains one folder per research phase. Edit the `index.md` inside each.
*   `templates/`: The standard template used to initialize new chapters.
*   `DRAFT_MASTER.md`: The autogenerated unified draft (Source of Truth).

## Data and Visuals
When adding data to a chapter, reference the `RunID` found in the `results/` or `core_status/` JSON files. For images, use relative paths to the `results/reports/visuals/` directory.
