# Master Plan: Publication Drafting Framework

## 1. Vision and Objective
The objective is to produce a "Gold Standard" research document that summarizes the Voynich Manuscript project's findings. This document must be simultaneously accessible to a curious layperson and rigorous enough to withstand intense peer review by skeptics and specialists.

### Core Philosophy
- **Structure-First, Solution-Last**: We are not "solving" the manuscript; we are defining the boundaries of what is admissible.
- **The Inverted Pyramid (per section)**:
    1. **Headline**: Clear, bold claim.
    2. **Layman’s Summary**: Simple analogy or plain-English explanation of the concept.
    3. **Technical Deep-Dive**: The math, data, and logic that support the claim.
    4. **Skeptic’s Corner**: Addressing counterpoints and existing studies.
- **Narrative Continuity**: Each research phase builds an epistemic wall, preventing the next phase from leaking into "interpretation" without justification.

## 2. Document Structure (The Narrative Arc)

### Part I: The Epistemic Crisis (Introduction)
- **Headline**: Why 600 years of "solutions" have failed.
- **Concept**: The danger of starting with a solution.
- **Technical**: Introduction of the Assumption-Resistant Framework.
- **Counterpoint**: Brief review of traditional decipherment attempts.

### Part II: The Bedrock (Layer 1: Foundation)
- **Headline**: The manuscript is a physical object, not a message.
- **Concept**: Establishing what is actually there (ink, geometry, patterns).
- **Technical**: Token distributions, Zipfian phase2_analysis, and repetition rates (with L1 visualizations).
- **Technical**: Provenance and reproducibility of the digital ledger.

### Part III: The Boundary (Layer 2: Analysis & Admissibility)
- **Headline**: Most explanations are structurally impossible.
- **Concept**: If it looks like a language but behaves like a machine, it might be a machine.
- **Technical**: Sensitivity sweeps, stability scores, and the rejection of natural language models.
- **Skeptic-Proofing**: How we use perturbation to prove that interpretation is often just finding "faces in clouds."

### Part IV: The Mirror (Layer 3: Synthesis)
- **Headline**: We can recreate the "mystery" without knowing the "meaning."
- **Concept**: If we can generate a page that "fools" our metrics, we have identified the manuscript's process.
- **Technical**: Comparison of real vs. synthetic metrics (Gap Analysis).
- **Technical**: Glyph-level grammars and constrained Markov processes.

### Part V: The Limit (Layer 4: Inference Evaluation)
- **Headline**: Decipherment methods are often false-positive machines.
- **Concept**: Proving that common "translation" tools can find "meaning" in random noise.
- **Technical**: False Positive Rate (FPR) testing of Information Theory and AI-assisted decoding.

### Part VI: The Mechanism & Function
- **Headline**: The Architecture of the System.
- **Concept**: How the manuscript "works" as a non-semantic system.
- **Technical**: Cross-correlation of visual regions and text placement.

### Part VII: Comparative & Human Analysis
- **Headline**: Where the phase7_human hand meets the algorithmic pattern.
- **Concept**: Comparing the Voynich structure to known historical oddities (grilles, glossolalia, steganography).

### Part VIII: The Horizon (Conjecture)
- **Headline**: What this implies for the future of the field.
- **Concept**: The "Safe Space" for creative interpretation, now that the boundaries are set.
- **Caution**: Explicitly labeled as the speculative section.

## 3. Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Tooling and Scaffolding
- **Format**: Use **Markdown** as the source of truth for version control, but employ **Pandoc** to export to **Microsoft Word (.docx)**.
- **Why MS Word?**: Allows for the specific layout, track-changes, and high-fidelity image placement required for a final publication draft.
- **Automation**: Create a script (`scripts/support_preparation/assemble_draft.py`) that:
    1. Pulls the latest findings from `results/`.
    2. Embeds visualizations from `results/reports/visuals/`.
    3. Combines template Markdown files into one master document.

### Phase 2: Content Templates
- Develop a standard template for each chapter:
    - `CONCEPT_SUMMARY.md`
    - `TECHNICAL_DATA.md` (autogenerated tables/metrics)
    - `VISUAL_EVIDENCE.md` (links to PNGs)
    - `SKEPTIC_COUNTERPOINT.md`

### Phase 3: Drafting Cycle
1. **The Bone Draft**: Assemble all metrics and visuals into the structure.
2. **The "Layman" Pass**: Write the simple-English summaries and headlines.
3. **The "Skeptic" Pass**: Critically evaluate the technical sections—where is the overreach?
4. **The "Review" Pass**: Finalize formatting and references.

## 4. Skeptic-Proofing Strategies
- **Negative Results as Primary Results**: If a test failed to distinguish real from synthetic, we emphasize that as a victory for the "non-semantic" hypothesis.
- **Open Data Reference**: Every claim must include a "Reproduce this" sidebar pointing to a specific CLI command and `RunID`.
- **Counter-Reference**: Cite the most popular decipherment papers and show *exactly* where they fall on our False Positive Rate charts.

## 5. Next Steps
1. [ ] Create the `/planning/support_preparation/templates/` directory.
2. [ ] Define the Pandoc configuration for `.docx` export (styles, fonts).
3. [ ] Map specific `results/*.json` files to the intended chapters.
