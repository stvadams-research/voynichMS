# 11. Discussion

## 11.1 Interpretive Context

While the formal analysis stops at mechanistic identification, the existence of such a disciplined system invites broader interpretation. The manuscript may be the residue of a ritualized formal activity, where the value lay in the act of execution rather than the transmission of a message.

The manuscript functions as a "paper computer" — a physical algorithm executed by human scribes. The scribes were not "writing" in the linguistic sense but "processing" a lattice of constraints. The resultant text is the trace of this cognitive and physical discipline. Analogies exist in monastic copying traditions, mandala construction, and prayer wheel operation — activities where the process of disciplined execution carries the meaning, not the output text itself.

## 11.2 Boundaries of This Analysis

This framework identifies the production mechanism class but does not — and cannot — determine authorial intent. Several possibilities remain structurally compatible with our findings:

- The manuscript is a deliberate demonstration of a combinatorial algorithm
- The manuscript is a ritual or meditative artifact where execution was the purpose
- The manuscript encodes meaning through a mechanism our diagnostics cannot detect (e.g., in visual elements, page ordering, or glyph-level steganography that operates outside the textual channel we analyzed)

What we can exclude is that the textual channel, as analyzed, carries natural language or any known cipher system. The mechanism is identified; the motive remains open.

## 11.3 Limitations

The Assumption-Resistant Framework operates exclusively on the textual channel of the manuscript. It does not analyze:

- Visual content (illustrations, diagrams, decorative elements)
- Physical properties (ink composition, parchment dating, binding structure)
- Spatial relationships between text and illustration beyond positional metadata
- Potential multi-channel encoding where meaning emerges from the combination of text and image

These are not weaknesses of the methodology — they are explicit boundaries. The ARF was designed to diagnose the text as a signal. If meaning exists outside the textual signal, it lies beyond the scope of this investigation and awaits its own assumption-resistant analysis.
