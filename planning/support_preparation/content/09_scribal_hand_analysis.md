# 9. Scribal Hand Analysis and System-Wide Invariance

Phase 7 tested whether the production mechanism is an individual trait or a shared system by examining its stability across different scribal hands, physical manuscript constraints, and known artifact categories.

## 9.1 Human Factors and Ergonomics (7A)

The manuscript was produced by a human over time, not mechanically. Corrections and uncertainty marks are present but sparse. Fatigue effects are detectable but mild, with weak negative correlation between line position and line length. Total production effort is substantial — approximately 356,000 estimated pen strokes — but well within sustained scribal capacity.

Execution was disciplined and practiced, not exploratory or improvisational. Errors are tolerated locally but do not propagate or induce revision. This eliminates pure ritual perfectionism, automatic mechanical copying, and casual one-off hoax production.

## 9.2 Codicological Constraints (7B)

The formal system shows weak or absent page-boundary effects on line length and structure. Layout geometry adaptation is weak, and illustration-proximity coupling is not supported by current evidence. The system is controlled by the scribe executing an abstract algorithm, not by the physical page.

Critically, strong coupling to scribal identity was detected: large differences in execution signatures (e.g., Type-Token Ratio) appear between hands. Multiple scribes can execute the same system with measurably different styles — the algorithm is shared, but the human executor modulates its expression.

No evidence of section-specific algorithms was found. The mechanism is globally invariant across all codicological sections. This eliminates spatially meaningful or diagram-driven generation and section-specific production mechanisms.

## 9.3 Comparative Formal Artifact Analysis (7C)

Against a comparative baseline of semantic language (Latin), self-citation/mechanical repetition, and table/grille-based non-semantic systems, the Voynich Manuscript occupies a distinct and isolated region of morphospace. Its nearest neighbor is table/grille systems, but with substantial residual distance.

The manuscript combines high novelty, high sparsity, partial convergence, and strong determinism — a profile not matched by any known artifact class. It is a custom-designed formal system, not a degraded language or trivial mechanism. Execution requires rule-following but not semantic evaluation.

## 9.4 Integrated Findings

Phase 7 establishes that the manuscript was produced by humans exercising discipline, not automation or deception. Current evidence supports weak page-geometry coupling. Individual scribes significantly influence execution style without altering the underlying rules. The cognitive posture required for execution does not involve ongoing semantic choice or adversarial decision-making. And the Voynich Manuscript does not belong to any known category of semantic or non-semantic formal artifact — it is structurally unique.
