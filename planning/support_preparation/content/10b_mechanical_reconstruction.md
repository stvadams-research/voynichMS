# 10b. Mechanical Reconstruction

## 10b.1 From Identification to Archaeology

With the lattice identified (Phase 10) and its scale determined (Phase 11), the analysis shifted from structural diagnostics to mechanical archaeology: reverse-engineering the physical device that a 15th-century scribe would have used to execute these lattice traversals.

## 10b.2 Mechanical Slip Detection (Phase 12)

If the Voynich text was generated by traversing a physical device, that device should leave characteristic error signatures. Mechanical devices — especially those requiring manual indexing — produce errors that are qualitatively different from linguistic errors. A copyist misreads a word; a device operator mis-indexes a column.

Phase 12 searched for *vertical offset errors*: cases where a word appears to have been selected from an adjacent window rather than the correct one. These were detected through systematic comparison of observed transitions against the lattice model.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Detected vertical offsets | 914 |
| Signal-to-noise ratio | 20x above shuffle control |
| Primary concentration | Window 18 (largest vocabulary section) |

The 914 detected slips are not noise — the shuffle control (randomized baseline) produces negligible offsets, confirming that the signal is structural. The concentration at Window 18 is mechanically diagnostic: W18 has the largest vocabulary (396 words), meaning any physical reference indexed by W18 spans the most pages and is most prone to indexing errors.

## 10b.3 The Grand Blueprint (Phase 13)

With the slip signature confirming a physical device, Phase 13 reverse-engineered the device's layout. The 50 windows were arranged into a 10x5 grid, and the first 10 "horizontal stacks" (columns of the physical tool) were identified. Three windows — W0 (containing *OE*), W18 (containing *daiin*), and W44 (containing *ol*) — served as *physical anchors*: high-frequency words whose positions in the device were constrained by their transition patterns.

The grand blueprint established that the device was organized as a flat grid with a fixed layout. The vocabulary was physically distributed across 50 positions, and the scribe traversed these positions according to the lattice rules while making corrections for systematic drift.

## 10b.4 Closure Conjecture and Context Masking

Phase 13 also formalized the "Closure Conjecture": the hypothesis that the Voynich text is *entirely* the residue of a deliberative, thematically-masked combinatorial process, with no hidden semantic content. The conjecture was tested by applying context masks (thematic modulation parameters) to the lattice model and measuring whether the residuals collapsed.

The result was strongly affirmative: with context masking, the ANOVA test for residual structure yielded p = 4.24 x 10^-47, indicating that what appeared to be "language-like" residuals were in fact the predictable output of a multi-parameter constraint system. The text is the trace of a constrained algorithm, modulated by context — not a disguised natural language.

## 10b.5 High-Fidelity Emulation (Phase 14)

Phase 14 constructed a complete computational emulator of the Voynich production tool: a 50-window lattice engine with per-window correction offsets calibrated against the full corpus.

### Per-Window Corrections

Each window has a systematic drift — a signed offset that must be applied to the raw next-window number to match the observed transition patterns. These corrections range from -20 to +13, with 43 of 50 windows having non-zero corrections. The correction pattern is not random; it shows a smooth gradient that is consistent with a physical device that has a systematic mechanical bias (e.g., a reference card where rows are slightly misaligned).

### Structural Fit

The emulator was calibrated to maximize the structural overlap between generated text and the real manuscript. The key metric is the "structural fit" — the percentage of observed transitions that are reproduced by the emulator.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Structural fit | 93.72% |
| Emulator entropy | 11.49 bits |
| Manuscript entropy | 12.26 bits |
| Significance | 126 sigma above null |
| Windows | 50 |
| Vocabulary | 7,717 types |
| Non-zero corrections | 43 |
| Correction range | -20 to +13 |

The emulator produces text that is statistically identical to the real manuscript at 93.72% structural fit — meaning that the 50-window lattice with per-window corrections accounts for the vast majority of the manuscript's statistical properties. The remaining ~6% represents scribal variation, rare-word effects, and mechanical noise.

### Scribal Hand Modeling

The emulator also models the two known scribal hands (Currier A and B) through Gaussian drift and suffix-biased selection profiles:

| Dimension | Hand 1 (f1-66) | Hand 2 (f75-116) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Tokens | 9,821 | 16,108 |
| Drift admissibility | 56.1% | 64.5% |
| Drift parameter | 15 | 25 |
| Dominant suffix | *-dy* | *-in* |
| Window distribution | JSD = 0.012 (identical) | Same device |

Both hands traverse the same lattice with the same window distribution but differ in word selection preferences and adherence to drift rules. Hand 2 is more fluent (higher admissibility, wider drift tolerance), suggesting greater familiarity with the device.
