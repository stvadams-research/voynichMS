## Authorship and Methodology Disclosure

With the exception of this section, the entirety of this research was produced autonomously by artificial intelligence. Over a twelve-day period (January 30 to February 11, 2026), a multi-model architecture—utilizing **auto-gemini-3**, **GPT-5.3-Codex**, and **Claude-opus-4-6**—was employed to write, audit, and execute 100% of the project's code and narrative synthesis. The models functioned within a framework of checks and balances to ensure structural consistency.

As this is an agentic exercise, no guarantee of absolute correctness is provided regarding the code, data, or results. It is presented in the hope that this novel approach and the resulting data may assist the academic community in its study of the manuscript. While methodological critiques and challenges are welcomed, the human facilitator lacks the specialized knowledge required to respond to technical inquiries. The full source code and project repository are available upon request.

## Abstract

For over a century, the Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke MS 408) has been presumed to contain a linguistic or cryptographic message. This study presents a structural identification of the manuscript based on an Assumption-Resistant Framework that explicitly excludes semantic intent as a starting premise. By reproducing the manuscript's entire digital ledger (N=222 folios) and subjecting it to rigorous perturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the text is structurally incompatible with natural language. The manuscript exhibits a Token Repetition Rate of {{phase1.repetition_rate}}, a Mapping Stability score of {{phase2.mapping_stability}}, and a Successor Consistency of {{phase5.5e.successor_consistency}} — values that place it decisively outside the structural envelope of any known communicative system.

Through an iterative process of hypothesis collapse across eight research phases, we identify the production mechanism as a Globally Stable, Deterministic Rule-Evaluated Lattice — a manual algorithm executed with high precision but indifferent to communicative efficiency. Our findings reclassify the manuscript from a "failed book" to a successful procedural artifact: a hand-executed formal system whose complexity arises from generative rules rather than linguistic encoding.

## Scope and Inferential Boundaries

This study does not assert the absence of meaning, nor does it claim the author's intent was fraudulent. It concludes only that non-semantic generative processes are structurally sufficient to explain the observed complexity of the text. The results establish a text-internal boundary for semantic inference: the observable structure does not support an inference of semantics under current diagnostics.
