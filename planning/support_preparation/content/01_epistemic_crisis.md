# 1. The Epistemic Crisis

The study of the Voynich Manuscript has long been trapped in a cycle of interpretation and falsification. Attempts to "read" the text assume, a priori, that there is a message to be read. This semantic assumption creates a self-reinforcing loop where statistical noise is easily mistaken for linguistic signal — a "hall of mirrors" in which every method finds what it expects to find.

The history of proposed solutions illustrates the problem. Hundreds of decipherment claims have been published, each internally consistent, yet mutually exclusive. The issue is not a lack of clever methods but an excess of unconstrained freedom: given enough flexibility, any mapping system can find apparent "meaning" in structured noise.

Our research breaks this cycle by adopting an Assumption-Resistant Framework. We do not ask "What does it mean?" but rather "What is it structurally?" By treating the manuscript as a physical signal rather than a semantic carrier, we are able to objectively map its production boundaries without presupposing the answer.

The framework proceeds through a disciplined sequence: establish the statistical baseline, test candidate production models against perturbation, exclude those that collapse, and converge on the narrowest class of mechanism that is structurally sufficient. Each phase builds an epistemic wall that prevents the next phase from leaking into interpretation without justification.
