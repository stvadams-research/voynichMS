# 10. Comparative Classification

Phase 8 quantified the structural distance between the Voynich lattice and known historical artifacts to place the manuscript within a broader typological context. The comparison space was carefully constructed with explicit non-semantic dimensions, a fixed scoring scale, and confound controls to prevent semantic drift.

## 10.1 Artifact Morphospace

A curated library of human-produced formal artifacts was assembled spanning natural language (as control), algorithmic and combinatorial systems, ritual and performative formalism, constructed and private scripts, pedagogical artifacts, and asemic/aesthetic systems. Each artifact was scored on identical dimensions: production constraints, execution ecology, human factors, layout dependence, and error tolerance.

The manuscript occupies a structurally isolated position in the resulting morphospace. It is not a cipher (too repetitive, no mapping stability). It is not gibberish (too structured, too consistent). It is not a simple table or list (too varied, with constrained novelty). Its nearest neighbor is combinatorial systems of the Lullian type, but that proximity is moderate, not decisive.

## 10.2 Classification Results

The comparative analysis established five key findings:

1. The Voynich Manuscript is not structurally close to natural language
2. It is not well explained by simple tables, grilles, or trivial generators
3. It behaves most like a disciplined, memory-augmented formal system
4. Its execution prioritizes rule adherence and state exhaustion over efficiency
5. Even under broad comparison, it remains sui generis

These are classification results, not explanations. The manuscript cannot be forced into any known artifact class without overreach.

## 10.3 Historical Context

The closest structural relatives are 15th-century combinatorial systems: High-Order Grilles and Lullian Wheels. These are mechanical aids that allow users to generate valid strings by following paths through a constrained network — precisely the operational model our analysis identifies. However, the Voynich Manuscript exceeds the complexity and discipline of any known surviving example from that period. It represents a custom, high-order formal system that surpasses simple combinatorial patterns.

## 10.4 Boundary Statement

Phase 8 demonstrated that expanding beyond the text stream does not rescue solvability. Manuscript-internal features (images, layout, codicology) constrain execution, not meaning. Comparative analysis asymptotically stops adding constraint. The manuscript cannot be forced into any known artifact class without overreach.

This completes the comparative program. Further narrowing requires either formal closure of inference limits or the introduction of non-textual comparative evidence — neither of which is within the scope of structural text analysis.
