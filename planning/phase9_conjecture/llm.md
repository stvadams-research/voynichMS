If I had to put money on a single “most likely” scenario, given everything you’ve established, it would be this:

The Voynich is a deliberately executed formal text-generator, built by a small number of humans, probably one primary designer and one or more scribes, created to function as an esoteric book whose value is the artifact itself, not the message. It is closer to a combinatorial or ritual-mnemonic engine than to a language or cipher. The pictures are there to sell “bookness,” create section identity, and anchor the performance or practice, not to caption plaintext.

Now I’ll spell out the story I think fits best, and then I’ll give you the best alternative stories that still fit pretty well.

Most likely scenario, in plain terms

A late medieval or early Renaissance person in a learned environment builds a “system” that produces writing-like output by rules. The system is simple enough to execute reliably for hundreds of pages, but rich enough to look organic. Think: a wheel/table/slot mechanism with memory, plus strong boundary resets.

They then wrap it in a manuscript format with illustrations that evoke known genres (herbal, astro, baths, pharma) because that makes it legible as a book to a reader even if the text is not. The manuscript’s purpose is to be a convincing, prestigious object that signals secret knowledge, not to transmit knowledge.

That purpose could be:

patronage bait, a showpiece for a buyer who wants mysterious expertise

a prestige artifact inside an esoteric circle, like a private “rite book”

a personal obsession project, executed for its own internal correctness

a “proof of mastery” artifact: look what I can make, look how disciplined it is

This is not “haha got you.” It is closer to the way people create elaborate ritual objects, or coded symbolic systems, or constrained artistic works. Serious, expensive, time-consuming, and not primarily communicative.

Why I think this is the best fit

Your results imply a weird combination:

Extreme line resets: the system “restarts” constantly.

High within-line determinism and high position sensitivity: it’s slot-driven.

Strong history dependence: it’s not just a static table, it has state.

Reuse suppression: it is actively avoiding the easiest move, repeating itself.

Indifference to efficiency: it’s not trying to compress or transmit.

Not adversarial: it’s not trying to resist learning, it just doesn’t care.

Scribal hand effects without mechanism drift: humans executing a fixed procedure.

That constellation screams “formal practice” more than “encoding.”

And Phase B pointing at Lullian-like combinatorial logic as the nearest neighbor is exactly the vibe: a generator that can be executed, produces lots of plausible variation, and can be done by hand.

So what was it “for,” if not meaning?

Here are the three “beer plausible” purposes I’d rank:

A prestige esoteric object for a patron
A commissioned mystery book, made to look like a lost science. The patron doesn’t need to read it, they need to own it. The illusion of depth is the deliverable.

This explains:

the lavish length

the disciplined execution

the genre-like illustrations

the lack of an external key (none needed)

why it sits structurally between systems and language

A mnemonic or ritual operating manual for an in-group
Not semantics in the way we mean it, but a system that cues action, memory, or performance for insiders. The “text” is more like notation: prompts and state markers.

This explains:

why the pictures matter but don’t decode the text

why the script can be stable yet unreadable

why line resets might correspond to “steps”

why efficiency is irrelevant

But it would usually leave some anchor, like repeated known tokens tied to visuals. You found that doesn’t force itself, which weakens this a bit.

A personal constrained-art obsession, pre-modern Codex Seraphinianus
Someone makes a whole worldbook. Not to fool anyone, but because building systems is fun and intoxicating. The outcome looks like a hoax because outsiders can’t place it.

This explains:

scale and discipline

aesthetic consistency

structural weirdness

lack of optimization

The harder part is historical plausibility, not possibility. But I would not underestimate how often humans do hard things for reasons that feel irrational from the outside.

Strong alternative scenarios (that still fit a lot)

Here are the best competing stories that could still be true.

A. It encodes meaning, but the encoding is not text-preserving
Meaning exists, but the surface is generated through a non-invertible or near-non-invertible process. Something like: you start with meaningful prompts, then expand them through a procedure that destroys recoverability.

In modern terms, it’s like hashing the message into structured nonsense, except done by hand. That would keep “purpose” while making decipherment impossible.

This is emotionally satisfying because it keeps meaning without making it solvable. The problem is: if meaning mattered, why suppress reuse and ignore efficiency so aggressively? It’s possible, but feels less natural.

B. It is a cipher, but not intended to be decrypted later
A one-time operational cipher, where the real use was in the act of writing or in oral context, and the written artifact is a residue. Like: the author already knew the content, the writing is ceremonial or archival but not for later reading.

This fits some ritual archives, but again, the manuscript format and volume are heavy for a purely ephemeral cipher.

C. It’s a training artifact for an invented script or method
A teaching manual for how to execute a generative system, not what it means. The text is worked examples. The pictures are category labels.

This would be my top alternative if we had evidence of “lessons” or progressive complexity. Your findings suggest global invariance rather than curriculum progression, which makes this less likely.

My “most likely” single bet

If forced into one sentence:

A learned person built a hand-executable combinatorial text engine (wheel/slot/table with memory and resets) and used it to produce a prestigious esoteric codex, where the primary product was the artifact’s aura of secret knowledge, not a recoverable message.
