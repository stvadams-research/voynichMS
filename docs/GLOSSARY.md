# Glossary

- **Admissibility:** The state of an explanation class (e.g., "Natural Language") being consistent with all observed structural constraints.
- **Indistinguishability:** A state where a synthetic artifact cannot be statistically separated from the real artifact by a specific set of metrics.
- **Generative Reconstruction:** The process of reverse-engineering the manuscript's mechanism by building a system that can reproduce it.
- **Mechanical Reuse:** The hypothesis that the scribe reused tokens from a limited pool without adaptive logic.
- **Procedural Generation:** Algorithmic creation of content based on rules, distinct from organic language production.
- **Glyph-Level Grammar:** Rules governing the sequence of individual characters (glyphs) rather than whole words.
- **Mapping Stability:** A metric measuring whether the identity of a text unit (word/glyph) persists when its geometric boundaries are slightly perturbed.
- **Z-Score (Information Density):** A statistical measure of how much more information-dense the manuscript is compared to a scrambled version of itself.
